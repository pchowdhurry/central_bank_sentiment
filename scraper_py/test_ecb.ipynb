      "[<p class=\"ecb-authors\">Prepared by Christian Höynck, Moreno Roma and Kathinka Schlieker</p>, <p>Published as part of the <a class=\"link-inline arrow\" href=\"/press/economic-bulletin/html/eb202502.en.html\">ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 2/2025</a>.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Developments in house prices play an important role in the economic and monetary analyses conducted by central banks.</strong> Notably, they are indicative of the strength of monetary policy transmission and of household balance sheet positions. Residential property prices, in conjunction with financing conditions, affect the affordability of housing and this can have knock-on effects for, among other things, construction activity and the rental market. This article reviews developments in the recent house price cycle in the euro area to better understand the possible implications for the economy.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">House price cycles typically follow a boom-bust pattern but can display marked differences in their underlying triggers and drivers.</strong> Assessing house price cycles in relation to business cycles only offers a partial perspective. While there is a fair degree of coherence between residential property price and real GDP cycles (Chart 1), the former tends to be longer and have a larger amplitude. Higher volatility associated with boom-bust patterns suggests a larger role for expectations (including speculation) in house price cycles in addition to fundamentals such as income and demand that govern both residential property price and real GDP cycles.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.1\" id=\"fn1\">1</a>]</sup> Moreover, the degree of synchronicity across countries is lower for house price cycles than real GDP cycles, suggesting that a euro area house price cycle can reflect many country-specific influences.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.2\" id=\"fn2\">2</a>]</sup> Therefore, this article focuses on stylised facts and broad drivers of house price cycles that are visible at the euro area-wide level.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The recent downturn in euro area house prices was relatively mild and short-lived.</strong> Data for the third quarter of 2024 suggest that the house price cycle has safely moved past its trough and the level of house prices has already recovered to that of the previous peak observed in the third quarter of 2022. This recovery has been much faster than those following the global financial crisis (GFC) and the sovereign debt crisis (SDC) (Chart 2, panel a). In retrospect, the peak-to-trough part of the cycle saw a cumulative decline of 3% over one and a half years, which was shallower and shorter than the almost 5% cumulative decline recorded over two years during the GFC and the SDC.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.3\" id=\"fn3\">3</a>]</sup> The relatively limited “bust” in house prices stands out compared with previous cycles, as the run-up to the peak in 2022 had been accompanied by estimated residential property price valuations relative to fundamentals that exceeded those observed at the peaks during the GFC and the SDC (Chart 2, panel b).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.4\" id=\"fn4\">4</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Disaggregation of euro area house price growth into different characteristics can provide additional insight into the features of the recent house price cycle.</strong> While euro area-wide house price dynamics during the GFC and the SDC were largely explained by what, at the time, was called “periphery” countries, recent dynamics were much more strongly driven by “core” countries (Chart 3), and in particular by Germany with its high weight in aggregate house prices. With only 12 of the euro area countries experiencing a decline in prices, the latest cycle was less pervasive than that during the GFC where all but one country experienced a downturn. The change in country composition of euro area-wide dynamics could point to a rotation of boom-busts in combination with an overall broad trend of rising house prices. For some countries, the shift to a more favourable interest rate environment after the introduction of the euro led to a boom-bust cycle that took quite some time to clean up and recover from (as in the case of Spain). During the low interest rate period following the GFC and the SDC, it was mainly other, previously less affected countries that saw their housing markets react to favourable financing conditions, with them eventually seeing a correction of exuberant price dynamics (as in the case of Germany).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The recent house price cycle saw more balanced developments between house prices in capital cities and the average house price in their respective countries.</strong> Up until the pandemic, house prices in capital cities had a history of growing more strongly than in their respective countries as a whole. At the same time, there was more acceleration and deceleration in the house price dynamics of capital cities (Chart 4). These differences are consistent with the notion that “location” is a key element in house prices and that dynamics are more buoyant in supply constrained markets. A larger share of affluent buyers and a perception of reliable resale values in good locations such as capitals can amplify price movements driven by fundamentals, expectations or speculation as compared with other locations. At the end of 2019, house prices in capital cities were 71% higher than during the pre-GFC period in early 2006, as compared with 28% for the euro area aggregate. The most recent house price cycle has somewhat realigned these relative dynamics, with house prices in euro area capital cities witnessing slower price dynamics than the euro area country average. This could reflect the already high and possibly less affordable price levels in capital cities but, more likely, also the specific and reinforcing impact of the pandemic and its implications for remote working that allowed workers to live further away from their offices and in less expensive locations.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.5\" id=\"fn5\">5</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">House price dynamics in the recent cycle reflected particularly buoyant developments in the prices of existing dwellings.</strong> These dwellings account for the bulk of housing transactions and their prices therefore typically define the shape of the overall house price cycle. At the peak of the cycle, the annual growth rate of prices for existing dwellings was half a percentage point higher than that of new dwellings and at the trough it was around 6 percentage points lower, a larger difference than that which had been observed in the GFC and – in particular – the SDC cycles (Chart 5). This likely reflects the long duration of the housing market upturn that may, towards its end, have increasingly been facing supply constraints for new dwellings, making buyers increasingly turn to existing properties. This was then reinforced during the pandemic when construction activity slumped and, at the same time, buyers were looking for dwellings that implied an upgrade in terms of square meters which could be situated in locations with hitherto lower price levels.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.6\" id=\"fn6\">6</a>]</sup> Once the exuberance element in buying existing dwellings had faded and energy costs became a more relevant element in the type of preferred housing, prices for existing dwellings dwindled much faster than those for new dwellings. The latter’s unwinding was also more constrained, as there were limits to lowering prices in view of the high construction costs under which new dwellings had been built in recent years.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The stylised facts indicate that the recent house price cycle was different from those during the GFC and the SDC.</strong> The price boom appears to have been broader based across categories and may reflect the fact that increases had also extended to less central locations or to less modern dwellings, particularly in relation to pandemic-related shifts in preferences. This implies that the boom may have come with less financial stretching and exposure of buyers than at other times and that this helped to contain the subsequent bust (Section 3). Ultimately, the price correction unwound the additional surge in prices in the aftermath of the pandemic but left the sustained increases recorded in pre-pandemic years in these price levels. The busts during the GFC and SDC cycles had implied relatively more erosion of previous multi-year price gains.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Model-based analysis suggests that, generally speaking, the largest driver in boom-bust house price cycles is the demand factor.</strong> The model used in Box 1 identifies housing-specific demand shocks as the main drivers of the house price downturns during the GFC and SDC cycles, but not during the latest downturn. Instead, aggregate supply shocks related to energy price shocks and pandemic-related supply disruptions had a relatively larger impact. Contrary to past cycles, the model also sees monetary policy more noticeably contributing to the recent downturn than the past declines in house prices. This is consistent with the profound change from a long period of low mortgage interest rates to a period of steep tightening of financing conditions and possible non-linear effects emanating from such a change.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.7\" id=\"fn7\">7</a>]</sup> Decompositions of house price developments into originating shocks can be a starting point for an assessment of driving factors but they are naturally model-specific, depending on the selection of variables and shocks and how these shocks are identified. Assessing house price cycles therefore also benefits from a model-free discussion of pertinent groups of factors and indicators.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.8\" id=\"fn8\">8</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Demand factors go some way towards explaining the recent house price cycle.</strong> Looking beyond the short-lived constraints in activity during the lockdown of the pandemic period, growth in housing investment and transactions point to a period of sustained strong housing demand in the run-up to the recent house price boom (Chart 6, panel a). This is also reflected in the continued rise of intentions to purchase or build a home to levels not seen since the introduction of the euro. Indeed, the pandemic period appears to have ultimately coincided with an additional boost in demand, likely related to housing relocations in times of an increased preference for remote working.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.9\" id=\"fn9\">9</a>]</sup> This is in line with a large shock in preferences that some models identify for the pandemic period as compared with what had been observed in previous house price cycles.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.10\" id=\"fn10\">10</a>]</sup> The subsequent fall in housing demand effectively unwound the exceptional pandemic surge in demand and was relatively limited. Housing investment and transactions declined but show signs of having bottomed out, and intentions to purchase a home have only seen a temporary dent at continued high levels (Chart 6, panel a). This provides the basis for the observed, relatively fast recovery in house prices.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Robust growth in disposable income supported housing demand and the debt servicing capacity of euro area households.</strong> Unlike in the GFC and SDC downturns, labour market conditions generally remained favourable during the recent house price cycle. Together with income support measures by governments during the pandemic and energy crises, this allowed household income to increase more than mortgage costs and contained the increase in the house price-to-income ratio during the house price boom (Chart 6, panel b). Households could afford higher mortgage payments and the savings accumulated during the pandemic also put them in a position to make larger downpayments. The financial burden for homeowners with a mortgage remained overall relatively low compared both with that for owners without a mortgage or that for tenants paying rents, as well as with what was the relative burden in earlier house price cycles.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.11\" id=\"fn11\">11</a>]</sup> In contrast to the GFC and SDC cycles, the recent downturn in house prices coincided with robust income developments and the decline in the house price-to-income ratio therefore implied an improvement in affordability that has underpinned the current recovery of house prices despite less favourable financing conditions than at the start of the house price cycle.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The role of tighter financing conditions in the adjustment of house prices was mitigated by relatively sound balance sheet positions.</strong> The sharp increase in interest rates in response to the 2022 surge in inflation coincided with still substantially overvalued house prices.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.12\" id=\"fn12\">12</a>]</sup> This could have been expected to lead to a much stronger bust in prices than was ultimately observed. One reason for differences with corresponding adjustments in the GFC and SDC cycles was that these overvaluations coincided with sounder household and bank balance sheet positions than had been the case at the time of the previous two cycles. Much lower mortgage credit growth and a lower debt service ratio compared with the pre-GFC period, which was partly due to the more widespread use of macroprudential policy, also implied more resilient household balance sheets and less risk of a disorderly unwinding of the house price boom, and consequently less volatility in the house price cycle (Chart 7).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.13\" id=\"fn13\">13</a>]</sup> Moreover, many euro area countries had moved in the direction of a stronger prevalence of fixed rate mortgages, which temporarily protect homeowners from higher borrowing rates and imply lower default rates that could exacerbate house price busts. At the same time, this suggests that, for many households, nominal mortgage payments are likely to increase once their current fixed rate contracts expire and are replaced by those with meanwhile higher interest rates.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.14\" id=\"fn14\">14</a>]</sup> The recent normalisation of interest rates limits this risk, as it kept the period during which households had to renegotiate their contracts at higher rates rather short. It also ends a short period in which the return on housing as an asset had become less attractive than the return on fixed income investments, which had therefore dampened the demand for housing.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.15\" id=\"fn15\">15</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The impact of monetary policy tightening on house prices also depends on the link between the housing market and the rental market.</strong> If higher interest rates imminently dampen affordability and therefore house purchases, households can be expected to turn more strongly to the rental market to satisfy their demand for shelter.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.16\" id=\"fn16\">16</a>]</sup> This should put downward pressure on house prices and upward pressure on rental prices (Box 2 discusses the relation between house prices and rental prices). However, the elasticity of households to shift between owning and renting depends on both the general level of rental prices and the availability of let property. In this respect, the tightening of financing conditions has also affected the attractiveness of investing in buy-to-let property and ultimately the supply in the rental market. This holds true even more if prices in the rental market are subject to regulation or if the availability in the rental market is subject to shocks such as immigration.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The impact of housing demand and monetary policy factors on house prices also depends on the state of the housing supply.</strong> In this respect, the model in Box 1 points to a relatively large role played by supply shocks in the recent house price downturn. This relates to both housing-specific and aggregate supply factors. Building permits, as a proxy for new housing supply, increased since the SDC cycle but remained at substantially lower levels than during the GFC cycle. In the recent house price downturn, they declined sharply reaching historical lows (Chart 8, panel a). This indicates that supply-side shortages prevail, and this helps to explain the relatively short-lived unwinding of house prices and their latest upturn as soon as improved financing conditions started to underpin demand. Economy-wide factors related to supply chain and energy price shocks also affected the construction sector and the supply of housing. Construction costs had risen sharply during the pandemic and post-pandemic periods related to both materials and labour shortages (Chart 8, panel b). This put upward pressure on house prices primarily via house prices for new buildings but also via those for existing buildings where the transaction was conditional upon prior renovation and maintenance. This has, for instance, been the case for measures that increase the energy efficiency of older buildings. The costs of such measures and the corresponding hesitance of potential buyers also help explain why prices for existing dwellings slumped much more than those for new dwellings.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Evidence from models and pertinent indicators corroborates the notion that the recent house price cycle exhibited some special features. </strong>This relates particularly to the strong upward demand shocks and their likely overlap with a strong preference shock during the house price boom. The pure unwinding of these shocks can explain a substantive part of the subsequent house price bust. The tightening of monetary policy and bank lending standards contributed to the turn of the cycle, despite resilient income fundamentals and constraints in the supply of housing.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The latest data confirm that the recent downturn in house prices was relatively mild compared with previous bust periods.</strong> By the third quarter of 2024, the level of house prices in the euro area had moved back above the earlier peak level in 2022. While estimates of housing valuations are surrounded by uncertainty, current readings imply that the relatively mild and short-lived decline in house prices implied less adjustment to overvaluations than had been observed during the GFC and the SDC house price cycles (although this adjustment has been more substantial in measures derived on the basis of real house prices). One reason for the limited adjustment is that the bust in house prices took place in a limited number of countries and, therefore, did not bear the same hallmarks as an outright recession as in previous periods, with income fundamentals remaining solid in the most recent house price cycle. In this respect, it resembled an orderly unwinding of the additional boost in house prices recorded during the pandemic period.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">While a relatively shallow bust in house prices circumvents adverse consequences for household and bank balance sheets, the level of house prices have remained high.</strong> This has negatively affected the affordability of housing despite a meanwhile less tight monetary policy. High construction costs and high purchase prices for housing currently stand in the way of generating additional supply in the housing market, which also implies scarcity in the rental market. In view of the combination of supply limitations and continued sound demand fundamentals, house price developments may well continue on their upward path, even though this may not be an entirely healthy outlook for the economy as a whole.</p>]\n",

Wages represent an input cost to firms. In turn, productivity-adjusted wages affect firms’ price-setting decisions and thus inflationary pressures, while workers base wage claims on current and past inflation and on inflation expectations. Moreover, wages represent a significant part of income for households and therefore affect consumption and saving decisions. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The past decade has seen significant changes in the conditions for wage growth, in terms of both price pressures and labour market conditions.</strong> The period from 2013 to 2017 was characterised by high albeit declining labour market slack, low inflation and subdued productivity growth which, together with some structural factors, kept a lid on wage growth. While inflation began to gradually pick up from 2018 and labour market tightness was increasing, wage growth remained low.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.1\" id=\"fn1\">1</a>]</sup> During the pandemic, headline inflation was muted, as were underlying wage dynamics, while both the unemployment rate and wages were affected by government measures to cushion the economic impact of the pandemic shock.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.2\" id=\"fn2\">2</a>]</sup> Following the post-pandemic reopening of the economy and Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine, inflation in the euro area increased to historically high levels which, combined with a tight labour market, resulted in historically high euro area wage growth. Headline inflation began declining considerably in 2023, while there have also been signs of weakening labour demand and wage growth has gradually been easing from a high level.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.3\" id=\"fn3\">3</a>]</sup> </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Such changes in the macroeconomic environment create challenges for assessing the relative importance of the drivers of wages.</strong> While lessons can be learned from the low inflation period, the changing economic landscape and data distortions during the pandemic require a reassessment of the standard tools and an extension of data sources used to analyse wage growth. Against this background, this article examines the drivers of wage growth in the extraordinary post-pandemic period (2022-24) through an augmented wage Phillips curve and through the analysis of new, granular data on wage agreements. It also illustrates the link between wage growth and inflation by applying the Bernanke-Blanchard model to the euro area.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.4\" id=\"fn4\">4</a>]</sup> </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The events influencing labour market developments after the pandemic had a heterogenous impact on wage indicators (Chart 1).</strong> A key indicator in the assessment of wage growth in the euro area is the annual growth rate of compensation per employee (CPE). This reflects the labour costs payable by employers – including wages, salaries and employers’ social contributions – expressed as an average per employee. The ECB monitors various other wage indicators for a more complete assessment of wage pressures, including compensation per hour (CPH) and negotiated wage growth. While CPE growth declined considerably during 2020, indicators of wage growth per hour worked, such as CPH, rose. These developments were driven by statistical factors linked to the pandemic and the use of job retention schemes, which distorted the information content of most wage indicators during this period in various ways. Accordingly, these indicators continued to be volatile in 2021 owing to base effects. By contrast, the ECB’s indicator of negotiated wages, which captures the outcome of collective bargaining processes, was not affected by statistical distortions.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.5\" id=\"fn5\">5</a>]</sup> It remained relatively stable at a low level during 2020 and 2021.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Following the surge in inflation, wage growth increased to levels not seen since before the advent of the monetary union, but different indicators accelerated at different speeds.</strong> CPE growth was the first of the wage indicators to follow the rise in euro area inflation, and in 2022 it was already above 4%. At that time CPH growth was about 1 percentage point lower. The difference reflected the recovery of average hours worked after the pandemic, which contributed to CPE growth on top of the more slowly rising hourly compensation. As the growth in average hours worked slowed down, the two measures began to grow at similar rates of above 5% in 2023. In contrast, negotiated wage growth strengthened more gradually, from just above 1% in 2021 to close to 3% in 2022 and above 4% in 2023. This more gradual adjustment reflected the fact that wage negotiations took some time to restart after the pandemic and were lengthy. Much of the difference between CPE and negotiated wages is captured by the wage drift, which made a much stronger than normal contribution to actual wage growth in the early stages of the high inflation period.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.6\" id=\"fn6\">6</a>]</sup> This high wage drift reflected not only the recovery in average hours worked but also ad hoc inflation compensation at firm level, partly incentivised by preferential tax treatments. As formal wage negotiations began to directly reflect inflation compensation, the wage drift component started to decline again, which was also reflected in a greater similarity between CPE and negotiated wage growth. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Recently, wage growth has been moderating from a high level, but again with different indicators moving at different speeds.</strong> As in the acceleration phase, negotiated wage growth also seems to be the most persistent and the last to adjust during the period of wage disinflation. While CPE and CPH growth both peaked in the second quarter of 2023, two quarters after the peak in HICP inflation, negotiated wage growth has remained high and volatile, reflecting the fact that wage contracts are of different lengths and workers that were locked into multi-year contracts suffered delays in their wages responding to the surge in inflation. The volatility of the negotiated wage series largely reflects the greater importance of one-off payments in recent years, but base effects due to these payments will have a downward impact in 2025. Information from the ECB wage tracker (see Section 4) and the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey also suggests a gradual easing of negotiated wage growth ahead.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.7\" id=\"fn7\">7</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Shocks in recent years have triggered changes in the drivers of wages.</strong> The cyclical position of labour markets, inflation developments and productivity growth are key drivers of wage growth, which economists frequently assess through the lens of a wage Phillips curve. Chart 2 shows how these drivers have developed. To correct for the considerable volatility related to job retention schemes in 2020, we interpolate the wage level and the productivity level – the variables most affected by job retention schemes – over the first and second quarters of 2020. This makes it easier to look through data distortions and understand how recent developments in most of the wage drivers have deviated from historical regularities beyond the distortions induced by the pandemic. Price inflation, captured in Chart 2 through HICP inflation, increased very quickly to historically high levels in 2022 but has returned to close to the ECB’s 2% target more recently. At the same time, the unemployment rate (inverted in the chart) has declined to its lowest level since the introduction of the euro. Finally, labour productivity growth has been below its long-term average for a prolonged period. The ECB’s augmented wage Phillips curve (Nickel, C. et al., op. cit.) captures the impact of these factors – (either past or expected) inflation, labour market state, and productivity – on actual wage growth while also accounting for lags. We will use this tool as a theoretical guide and an empirical device to assess wage developments using a variety of specifications.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.8\" id=\"fn8\">8</a>]</sup> </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Catching up with past inflation has been an important driver of recent wage growth.</strong> The quick, sizeable and unexpected surge in consumer prices resulted in a decline in real wages across euro area countries and sectors. On average, real wages declined by about 5% between the start of the inflation surge in mid-2021 and the peak of headline inflation (Chart 3). Workers will seek to recoup their real wage losses, meaning that wage demands will reflect the difference between actual real wage levels and real wage expectations, conditional upon labour market conditions.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.9\" id=\"fn9\">9</a>]</sup> Thus real wage catch-up has been an important driver of recent wage growth. Real wage levels are not included directly in the basic wage Phillips curve, but these can be incorporated indirectly by including past inflation and lagged wage growth in alternative specifications. The assessment of this factor will be enriched by looking at granular wage negotiation data in the next section. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">It is a priori unclear to what degree wage dynamics reflect past inflation as opposed to forward-looking inflation expectations.</strong> This may differ strongly among workers and may also depend on the actual level of inflation. To address this uncertainty, in the augmented wage Phillips curve we capture the impact of inflation on wages by including a measure of either backward or forward-looking inflation, selected from a wide range of possible indicators.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.10\" id=\"fn10\">10</a>]</sup> All these indicators increased relative to their past values. However, they have deviated strongly since the beginning of the high inflation period (much more so than previously), with backward-looking indicators rising earlier and to a higher level than forward-looking indicators, and longer-term expectations remaining relatively stable (Chart 4).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.11\" id=\"fn11\">11</a>]</sup> </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Wage Phillips curve estimations confirm that the reaction of wages to past inflation has been the major driver of recent wage inflation.</strong> Although the prevalence of wage indexation is relatively low in the euro area, before the pandemic inflation compensation in wage formation was influenced primarily by backward-looking inflation.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.12\" id=\"fn12\">12</a>]</sup> Such wage formation may increase the persistence of nominal variables and could amplify second-round effects. Inflation may play a greater role in wage formation in a period of high inflation because firms and workers are more attentive to it than when inflation is low. During the high inflation period and the subsequent disinflation, past inflation and shorter-term inflation expectations explain a larger part of wage developments. Models that include past inflation and short-term inflation expectations can explain a large part of the upward phase of wage growth, while in the wage disinflation phase past inflation appears to have made a somewhat larger contribution. In contrast, models that include long-term inflation expectations point overall to a lower estimated impact of inflation on wage formation (Chart 5). Recently, as HICP inflation has eased, the contribution of inflation to wage growth has also been easing in most specifications with backward-looking or short-term inflation measures, but it nevertheless remains high. Overall, this finding confirms that there is a strong backward-looking element in wage formation in the euro area, which in the recent period is also related to the strong surprise element of the inflationary shock. This is in line with the application of the Bernanke-Blanchard model to the euro area.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.13\" id=\"fn13\">13</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Various indicators on the state of the labour market have been pointing to tightness, although to different degrees.</strong> The period since 2022 has been characterised by the lowest unemployment rate since the introduction of the euro in 1999. The headline unemployment rate has also been lower than estimates of its non-inflationary rate (for example, the European Commission’s non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment – NAWRU), confirming the signals for labour market tightness.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.14\" id=\"fn14\">14</a>]</sup> Other measures of the labour market state that are used as alternative indicators in the augmented wage Phillips curve specifications (e.g. the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio and the European Commission’s measure of labour as a factor limiting production) have been pointing to an even stronger increase in labour market tightness than the unemployment rate. One possible reason for this is that these two indicators include labour demand more directly, while the unemployment rate reflects the balance between labour demand and labour supply, where adjustments in the labour force may satisfy labour demand. Recently, indicators of labour demand have been easing from a high level, while the unemployment rate has been more stable (Chart 6).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Labour market tightness has contributed to recent wage growth.</strong> The unemployment rate points to greater upward pressure on wage growth than the historical average. However, since 2022 wage growth has been more closely aligned with the dynamics of the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio and the European Commission’s indicator on labour limiting production. Wage Phillips curve specifications that include these indicators point to a stronger impact of labour market tightness, suggesting they are more informative about wage growth in the recent period (Chart 7). At the same time, the dynamics of recent wage growth more closely follows that of the contribution from (past) inflation, while labour market tightness has likely acted as a supporting factor for real wage catch-up. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">A wage decomposition based on a range of augmented wage Phillips curve specifications attributes the recent high wage inflation primarily to high price inflation but, as the role of price inflation is declining, the relative impact of the labour market is increasing.</strong> In the decomposition, we consider an average of various specifications with different labour market and inflation variables. Comparing the main wage drivers, inflation seems to have been the main driver of wage growth in recent years (Chart 8). The more recent easing of CPE growth is also driven by a lower contribution from inflation. In contrast, the contribution of labour market developments is smaller but is not estimated to have declined.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.15\" id=\"fn15\">15</a>]</sup> Labour productivity has been weak recently, and this may have dampened overall wage growth. The estimated correlation between productivity and wage growth is very low at the business cycle frequency, and the estimated contribution of productivity to actual CPE growth is very small and primarily negative.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.16\" id=\"fn16\">16</a>]</sup> Finally, there has been a positive residual, reflecting the presence of some factors which are not captured by the augmented wage Phillips curve models. These factors could be the interplay of labour market tightness and high inflation, but the unexplained part may also reflect the fact that the wage Phillips curve is limited in its ability to capture real wage catch-up.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.17\" id=\"fn17\">17</a>]</sup> A wage decomposition based on a subset of these augmented wage Phillips curve specifications where the inflation component is only backward-looking increases the relevance of the inflation component and reduces the residual in the post-pandemic era. Such a finding underscores the role the recent high inflation has played in shaping wage growth.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The ECB wage tracker provides a timely assessment of negotiated wages.</strong> Wage indicators are released with a considerable time lag, and recently, as shown in the previous section, assessing these data has been challenging. In the high inflation period there was a particularly strong need for more timely indicators and approaches. One significant development has been the introduction of the ECB wage tracker, which uses granular data on existing collective bargaining agreements.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.20\" id=\"fn20\">20</a>]</sup> The ECB wage tracker provides both backward-looking information on negotiated wage growth pressures and very timely forward-looking signals on expected future negotiated wage growth during the coming months.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.21\" id=\"fn21\">21</a>]</sup> This indicator is one of several new data sources, including survey-based wage indicators, developed at the ECB since the onset of the pandemic.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.22\" id=\"fn22\">22</a>]</sup> </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Granular data on wage negotiations can help explain the role of inflation compensation as a driver of such negotiations.</strong> The ECB wage tracker made it easier to anticipate the gradual increase in euro area negotiated wages starting in 2022 and to understand the considerable country heterogeneity (Chart 9). In this article, we use this tool to understand the features of wage negotiations using granular data at the agreement level. In particular, we assess the role of real wage catch-up demands in the gradual increase in negotiated wage growth and in the composition of negotiated wages. We differentiate between structural increases – i.e. changes that affect base wages – and one-off payments, and we assess the role of institutional factors in the pace of real wage catch-up.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.23\" id=\"fn23\">23</a>]</sup> </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">One important factor behind the heterogenous speed of adjustment of negotiated wages to inflation is the length of previous collective bargaining agreements.</strong> Institutional factors, such as the frequency of collective bargaining negotiations and the length of agreements, can influence the dynamics of underlying wage pressures. Understanding how quickly social partners can react to economic shocks and renegotiate collective bargaining agreements is therefore key to assessing the pass-through of inflation to wages. Long contract durations limit the scope for employers to adjust to macroeconomic shocks but, at the same time, provide a safeguard for employees regarding their future compensation, as it is less dependent on the business cycle. However, in a high inflation period, long contract durations can lead to substantial real wage losses, especially when the strong inflationary shocks were not accounted for in the previous wage negotiation. Long contract duration can also increase the volatility of negotiated wage series when inflation is unexpectedly high, since in this case there is a large accumulated real wage gap to be closed or narrowed in future wage negotiations. For example, retail and wholesale sector workers in Germany recently negotiated a new wage agreement for the first time in three years. To compensate for the cumulated real wage loss, they agreed large one-off payments as well as significant structural wage increases (i.e. growth in regular payments, excluding one-offs) in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in record negotiated wage growth (as shown in Chart 1).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">ECB wage tracker data suggest that recorded contract durations differ greatly within the euro area.</strong> In France and Austria, collective bargaining agreements last on average around 12 months. By contrast, in Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, agreements are usually valid for two years or more. In Italy and Spain, the distribution of workers by contract duration exhibits several peaks, some at significant intervals such as five or six years, which is uncommon in other countries (Chart 10, panel a). Aggregating the ECB wage tracker data at the euro area level reveals that 13% of workers are covered by contracts lasting one year or less and which have been renegotiated at least three times since 2021. As the contract duration lengthens, the renegotiation frequency naturally decreases. One-third of workers have contracts lasting one to two years, and there have been a large number of agreements in this segment since 2021, reflecting the sometimes staggered and slow nature of collective bargaining. Contracts with a duration longer than two years, which cover 54% of workers, have been renegotiated only once or twice since 2021 (Chart 10, panel b).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Shorter contracts enable wage growth to respond more quickly to inflation.</strong> Structural wage growth among contracts renegotiated every year increased from 2.0% in 2021 to 5.1% in 2022 and 6.0% in 2023, before easing to 3.5% in 2024. While these contracts still reflect staggered wage dynamics, they suggest that negotiated wage pressures will continue to ease as long as inflation does not suddenly increase again. Contracts with longer durations display a more gradual structural wage adjustment, with lower recorded wage growth in 2022 and higher wage growth in 2023 and 2024. Thus, contracts with longer durations displayed a weaker immediate response to the inflation surge in 2022 and stickier and higher wage growth in the subsequent years. Still, wage pressures for longer duration contracts are also easing, as already seen in 2024 in the wage growth dynamics of contracts with an average duration of two years (Chart 11).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">As most of the workers covered by the ECB wage tracker have renegotiated their wages since the start of the inflation surge, real wage catch-up is easing as a factor, as confirmed by the forward-looking tracker.</strong> A significant share of collective bargaining agreements expired in 2024, affecting more than 30% of the workers covered by the ECB wage tracker database. Moreover, a further 15% will see their agreements expire in the first half of 2025. Of these, a substantial majority were agreed in either 2023 or 2024, suggesting that most workers have already received wage increases or one-off payments compensating for inflation. Very few of the contracts that are expected to be renegotiated by the second quarter of 2025 have not already been renewed at least once since 2023. Accordingly, the vast majority of contract renegotiations are anticipated to result in lower wage growth than was agreed in 2023 and 2024, driven partly by the more flexible, or less staggered, wage adjustment of contracts with lower durations (Chart 12). This, together with the lower wage drift, will bring overall wage pressures down.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">As the unusual shocks of recent years are slowly dissipating, wage growth is gradually easing.</strong> Wage growth is an important factor influencing the inflation outlook, and understanding its drivers is crucial. The augmented wage Phillips curve approach points to real wage catch-up as the main driver of recent high wage growth, which was supported by tight labour markets. In contrast, productivity growth has played a negligible role. The estimated inflationary impact reflects developments in past inflation and captures – although imperfectly – the real wage catch-up process. This factor is slowly dissipating, as is also confirmed by granular data in the ECB wage tracker, allowing wage growth to edge down, which is further supported by the easing of labour demand. At the same time, the wage channel is playing a key role in explaining inflation dynamics, so it remains important to monitor wage developments.</p>]\n",

The reformed SGP aims at ensuring sustainable fiscal positions, which are key for price stability and sustainable growth in a smoothly functioning Economic and Monetary Union. In addition, the SGP aims to balance fiscal adjustment needs with the need to enhance the implementation of productive investment and reforms, with a particular focus on strategically relevant areas such as the green and digital transitions and defence.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The submission and endorsement of the first set of national medium-term fiscal-structural plans (MFSPs) was a milestone in the implementation of the reformed economic governance framework.</strong> Last year EU Member States prepared the first set of MFSPs under the reformed economic governance framework. As a rule, such plans span four or five years, depending on the length of the national electoral cycle. In the plans, each EU Member State commits to a multi-year public net expenditure path and explains how it will deliver investments and reforms that respond to the main challenges identified in the context of the European Semester.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.2\" id=\"fn2\">2</a>]</sup> <a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Hlk188263038\"></a>The EU’s Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN Council) endorsed the MFSPs of most Member States, issuing corresponding recommendations on 21 January 2025.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.3\" id=\"fn3\">3</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">In view of heightened geopolitical tensions and the need to step up defence capabilities in Europe, on 19 March 2025 the European Commission proposed a coordinated activation of the “national escape clause”.</strong> This clause had already been introduced as part of the reform of the SGP and will allow Member States to deviate – on grounds of higher defence expenditure – from the net expenditure paths set out in their MFSPs or from their corrective path under the excessive deficit procedure (EDP). If already endorsed by the ECOFIN Council, the MFSPs of the Member States will not need to be revised for additional defence spending. There is flexibility for such additional spending on defence, up to a limit of 1.5 percentage points of GDP per year over 2025-28 compared with existing fiscal commitments, in countries that choose to request the activation of the national escape clause. However, the SGP framework requires that deviations from the endorsed net expenditure paths do not endanger fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Countries which have not yet submitted plans, or the MFSP of which has not yet been endorsed, are expected to receive equivalent treatment to the other Member States when requesting activation of the national escape clause.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">This article reviews the MFSPs to provide a first assessment both of the fiscal and economic implications of the reformed SGP over the short and medium term and of the implications of coordinated activation of the national escape clause.</strong> Section 2 recalls how the requirements of the reformed fiscal rules compare with the previous regime. Section 3 reviews the fiscal paths outlined in the MFSPs and assesses risks to the outlook for government debt (Box 1) as well as growth and inflation. Section 4 discusses the European Commission’s proposal to provide flexibility for defence spending within the SGP. Section 5 aims to establish whether the revised SGP will trigger additional reforms and investment, and Section 6 concludes.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The new risk-based surveillance approach under the reformed SGP builds on Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) to guide fiscal adjustment paths so that government debt is brought onto a plausibly declining path by the end of an adjustment period. </strong>This period can be either four years, or up to seven if an extension is granted.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.4\" id=\"fn4\">4</a>]</sup><sup> </sup>This approach is complemented by so-called numerical safeguards for deficit and debt reduction as well as minimum requirements when a country is subject to an EDP.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.5\" id=\"fn5\">5</a>]</sup> In June last year each Member State with a debt ratio above 60% of GDP and/or a deficit ratio above 3% of GDP in 2024 received a “reference trajectory” from the European Commission as prior guidance. Those Member States with low deficit and debt ratios received technical information, if requested. A reference trajectory spells out fiscal adjustment requirements in terms of maximum growth rates for net expenditure.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.6\" id=\"fn6\">6</a>]</sup> These are derived from the changes in the structural primary balance that underlie the DSA. The net expenditure concept serves as the single operational indicator under the revised fiscal governance framework, replacing the previous surveillance approach that built on the structural budget balance, i.e. the cyclically adjusted balance net of temporary measures. A control account will monitor deviations from these net expenditure paths, possibly triggering a debt-based EDP if cumulated deviations exceed certain numerical thresholds.<sup> </sup><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.7\" id=\"fn7\">7</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Compared with the previous regime, the risk-based surveillance approach implies more differentiated fiscal adjustment requirements (Chart 1).</strong> Under the previous SGP framework, Member States had to converge towards medium-term budgetary objectives, i.e. close-to-balance underlying fiscal positions. Annual adjustment requirements were calibrated based on a “matrix approach”, accounting for cyclical conditions and the level of debt. Effectively, country differentiation was limited – despite large differences in the levels of government debt. The new approach rests on the projected evolution of public debt. Accordingly, it recognises that fiscal discipline is an intertemporal issue, implying higher adjustment requirements where debt challenges are more pronounced and/or where initial budgetary positions are less favourable. Chart 1 highlights the fact that several Member States with low indebtedness are facing very limited adjustment requirements under the revised fiscal framework – or even have room for stimulus. This holds for the requirements under the default four-year adjustment period as compared with the requirements which would have applied going forward if the previous SGP had remained in place. However, for several countries with elevated debt ratios the requirements lie mostly well above historical observed adjustments before the pandemic. In most cases the adjustments delivered were significantly lower than the average historical requirements, which were around 0.5% of GDP.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The option to extend the adjustment period from four years to seven years, in return for commitments to structural reforms and public investment, potentially provides sizeable room for fiscal manoeuvre.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.8\" id=\"fn8\">8</a>]</sup> The reformed framework recognises the medium-term benefits of productive public investment and productivity-enhancing structural reforms for fiscal sustainability. Such beneficial effects materialise via the denominator effect: higher economic growth translates into a lower debt-to-GDP ratio. Therefore, Member States can opt for an extended seven-year adjustment period if this is supported by respective policy commitments. Chart 1 shows that adjustment requirements can be reduced significantly by opting for an extended adjustment period (the blue bars indicate the average annual adjustment with an extension, while the orange bars quantify the additional adjustment that would be required in the standard four-year scenario).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">On 21 January 2025 the ECOFIN Council adopted the Commission’s recommendations to endorse 15 of the 16 MFSPs submitted by euro area Member States.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.9\" id=\"fn9\">9</a>]</sup> Belgium submitted its MFSP on 19 March and neither a Commission assessment nor an ECOFIN Council decision are available as yet. Three euro area countries have not yet submitted their plans, namely Germany, Lithuania and Austria.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">So far, only 5 of the 17 euro area countries that have submitted MFSPs have opted for an extended adjustment period by committing to reforms and investment – though these countries represent half of the euro area economy.</strong> Specifically, Belgium, Spain, France, Italy and Finland <a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Hlk185241538\"></a>have opted to extend the adjustment period by three years and committed to a relevant set of reforms and investments (Chart 2, panel a).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">A number of euro area countries accounting for over two-fifths of euro area GDP have either not submitted a plan or are considered to lack political backing for the submitted plan, posing risks to the near-term fiscal outlook (Chart 2, panel b).</strong> Spain has submitted its MFSP, but its Parliament has not been able to pass the draft budget for 2025. Germany, Lithuania and Austria have still to submit their plans.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Several MFSPs deviate from the European Commission’s prior fiscal guidance, mostly reflecting updated budgetary and macroeconomic information.</strong> The planned cumulative net expenditure growth rates are higher than those of the Commission’s reference trajectories in most Member States, as indicated by values above the 45-degree line in Chart 3, panel a. The differences mainly relate to the fact that the initial Commission guidance had been provided to Member States on 21 June 2024, while MFSPs were only submitted later, in the autumn. By then more recent information was available on the fiscal positions in 2024 that served as the starting point for the DSA-based adjustment requirements. Updated macroeconomic assumptions were mostly assessed as duly justified by the Commission, but highlight how sensitive the new fiscal framework is to the assumptions made (see Box 1).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">All Member States facing high debt sustainability risks have to plan for lower average net expenditure growth rates, also because their primary spending ratios are comparatively large.</strong> As shown in Chart 3, panel c, some of these countries record primary spending ratios of about 40% of GDP or above. Given that the net expenditure growth rates are derived from these ratios, the higher these are, the lower the expenditure growth ceilings must be to achieve the same amount of fiscal adjustment. Equally, where the fiscal efforts required are higher in terms of improvement in the structural primary balance ratio, this implies lower net expenditure growth, on average, in the MFSPs.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The fiscal adjustment efforts in the MFSPs appear to be in line with the “no backloading” requirement in the revised economic governance framework.</strong> Chart 4 shows that the average improvement in the structural primary balance position over the first two years of the plans (2025 and 2026) is, in the vast majority of cases, either equal to or greater than the average adjustment planned for 2025‑28. This suggests that Member States do not plan to backload their fiscal adjustment to the years towards the end of the planning period.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The European Commission’s</strong> <a class=\"link-inline external\" href=\"https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-and-fiscal-governance/stability-and-growth-pact/preventive-arm/annual-draft-budgetary-plans-dbps-euro-area-countries/draft-budgetary-plans-2025_en\"><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Opinions</strong></a> <strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">on the 2025 draft budgetary plans of the euro area countries suggest, in some cases, fiscal gaps vis-à-vis the net expenditure paths contained in the MFSPs, resulting in debits on the control account.</strong> Box 1 highlights that such debits, if combined with a resetting of the account by a newly appointed government, can materially reduce the consolidation effort over the MFSP horizon. As shown above, such consolidation efforts already tend to be lower than figures derived from the Commission’s reference trajectories and their underlying assumptions. Such deviations from the reference trajectory can have tangible adverse effects on the debt trajectory, in particular for countries with high debt ratios.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Finally, before the announcements on defence spending flexibility, Eurosystem staff assessed that consolidation efforts under the revised SGP would have limited adverse macroeconomic effects overall, particularly if productive public investment is at least maintained.</strong> The macroeconomic implications of the consolidation needs under the revised EU framework are relevant for a comprehensive assessment of the new SGP rules. A preliminary analysis in early 2024, before countries started submitting MFSPs, found that abiding fully by the SGP consolidation requirements would imply some short-term downside risks to growth at the euro area level and muted effects on inflation.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.10\" id=\"fn10\">10</a>]</sup> An updated analysis for the period 2025-27, as part of the 2024 December Eurosystem staff projections, takes into account the new information in the MFSPs and the 2025 draft budgetary plans. In particular, it incorporates the chosen adjustment periods and the planned structural efforts. It broadly confirms the previous assessment of limited adverse macroeconomic effects.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.11\" id=\"fn11\">11</a>]</sup> Some of the measures outlined in the government plans – those measures well specified – were included in the December baseline projections. Overall this induced slight revisions to the baseline growth and inflation projections.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.12\" id=\"fn12\">12</a>]</sup> The <a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Hlk192599903\"></a>estimated macroeconomic and fiscal effects are surrounded by uncertainty. This is especially the case for those countries which have not yet submitted an MFSP or where the plan is already outdated. Another source of uncertainty is the potentially different composition of the consolidation ultimately implemented by governments. Moreover, in the absence of fiscal adjustment, confidence effects may play an important role – especially in the high-debt countries. Finally, the additional potential defence spending allowed under the rules in the context of heightened geopolitical tensions has increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the euro area. An increase in defence and infrastructure spending could add to growth and also raise inflation through its effect on aggregate demand.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.13\" id=\"fn13\">13</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Following the endorsement of the MFSPs of most EU Member States by the ECOFIN Council and in light of geopolitical developments, in March 2025 the European Commission proposed the coordinated activation of the national escape clause under the SGP.</strong> This was part of the European Commission’s ReArm Europe Plan/Readiness 2030, as announced on 19 March 2025.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.14\" id=\"fn14\">14</a>]</sup> In early March EU leaders had welcomed the Commission’s stated intention to recommend that the Council activate, in a coordinated manner, the national escape clause under the SGP. The Commission was also called on to explore further measures to facilitate significant defence spending at national level in all Member States while ensuring debt sustainability.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.15\" id=\"fn15\">15</a>]</sup> It provided greater detail on the implementation of the national escape clause in a <a class=\"link-inline pdf\" href=\"https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/document/download/a57304ce-1a98-4a2c-aed5-36485884f1a0_en?filename=Communication-on-the-national-escape-clause.pdf\">Communication</a> published on 19 March.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The Commission will activate the national escape clause in the SGP on grounds of exceptional circumstances outside the control of Member States, which has important implications for the implementation of the MFSPs.</strong> Specifically, Member States will need to submit their requests by the end of April. Activating the clause allows a Member State to deviate from its net expenditure path as set by the ECOFIN Council or from the corrective path under the EDP, <em>provided that such deviation does not endanger fiscal sustainability over the medium term</em>. The budgetary flexibility for Member States activating this clause will be granted on two conditions. First, there will be a cap of 1.5% of GDP on additional spending per year for 2025-28 – for each Member State irrespective of its distance to/from NATO’s 2% of GDP target for defence expenditure. Any increases beyond that cap will be subject to the usual assessments of compliance. Second, the additional fiscal space is to be used for extra defence expenditures and is to include both investment and current expenditure.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.16\" id=\"fn16\">16</a>]</sup> The increase in defence expenditure covered by flexibility under the national escape clause will be calculated relative to 2021 – the reference year. After 2028, Member States will have to sustain the higher spending level through gradual reprioritisation within their national budgets in order to safeguard fiscal sustainability.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Apart from the flexibility granted for defence spending, the fiscal framework should continue to operate normally.</strong> Concretely, the net expenditure growth ceilings of Member States as set out in their MFSPs remain valid. This implies that EU fiscal surveillance will monitor countries’ compliance with the net expenditure paths included in the national plans and – where applicable – the EDP recommendations. The assessment of compliance with agreed spending ceilings is, however, to be conducted in a way that nets out the amount of defence spending subject to the escape clause. Therefore, in the absence of compensatory measures, debt trajectories would deviate from those projected at the time of endorsement. The implications of the triggering of national escape clauses for additional defence spending are analysed in Box 1.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Another key design feature of the revised governance framework is its aim of fostering productive investment and growth-enhancing reforms.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.20\" id=\"fn20\">20</a>]</sup> Member States opting for an extension need to make sure that the planned level of nationally financed public investment is no lower during the MFSP period than its previous medium-term level. The European Commission operationalises this by comparing the average ratio to GDP of nationally financed public investment over the planning period with the average level over the period covered by the respective Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP), i.e. 2021/22 to 2026. In its assessments of the MFSPs, the Commission finds that four euro area countries that have opted for an extension of the adjustment period so far meet the condition (Spain, France, Italy and Finland).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.21\" id=\"fn21\">21</a>]</sup> The revised rules require that countries seeking an extension of their fiscal adjustment period commit to a set of adequate reforms, thereby increasing reform incentives. These reforms should respond to the main policy challenges identified in the context of the European Semester. Ultimately, the reforms in the national plans should lead to higher potential output growth and thereby reduce fiscal adjustment needs.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Nationally financed public investment is planned to remain at or above average pre-pandemic levels in all five euro area countries that opted for an extended adjustment period.</strong> Chart 5 compares nationally financed government investments as a percentage of GDP over 2025-28 with the average for 2014-19. This average can provide additional insights relative to the Commission’s operationalisation, because the period concerned was not affected by the large investments foreseen in the RRPs. The national plans for Belgium, Spain, Italy and Finland aim at reaching a level of nationally financed government investment that is, on average, significantly above the 2014-19 average. Only the French plan maintains nationally financed government investment broadly at the levels observed in 2014-19. Public investment commitments in the MFSPs appear to mostly overlap or complement existing measures included in the RRPs. In Iine with the revised economic governance framework, the Commission assesses these as addressing the common priorities of the EU, including the green and digital transitions.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The reforms supporting an extension of the adjustment period focus mainly on the public sector.</strong> The plans of the five euro area countries seeking an extension of the adjustment period include 71 extension-related reforms. Half of them can be broadly categorised as public sector reforms, for instance aiming to enhance tax administration or the judiciary (Chart 6). Labour market, education and social policies account for around one-fifth of all planned reforms. The categories “business environment” and “green/digital framework conditions” account for 15% and 12%, respectively. The remaining reforms are related to financial policies (4%), most notably insolvency frameworks and the housing market. With its focus on public sector reforms, the reform mix in the fiscal-structural plans is therefore comparable to that envisaged by the RRPs.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.22\" id=\"fn22\">22</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Most of the planned reforms are either already included in the RRPs or designed to complement them.</strong> While the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) is in operation, the revised governance framework allows Member States to include in their MFSPs reforms that have already been implemented or planned in the context of the RRPs. Some 37% of the reforms underpinning an extension of the adjustment period fall into this category (Chart 7). Another 37% of the relevant reforms are designed to complement or extend those set out in the RRPs. The remaining 26% can be seen as new, stand-alone reforms without a direct connection to the RRPs, such as the planned streamlining and improvement of the efficiency of state-owned enterprises in Italy.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The growth impact of the suggested reforms is difficult to assess.</strong> First, there is no agreed methodology for determining the potential quantitative impact of reforms on the fiscal adjustment required under the new rules.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.23\" id=\"fn23\">23</a>]</sup> Among the five euro area countries seeking an extension of the adjustment period, only Spain and Italy provide comprehensive estimates of the expected growth impact that, though not comparable, are based on specific models or comparisons with baseline scenarios. Second, so far the reforms are only public commitments – important parameters concerning the design and implementation of the reforms are still to be decided. Therefore, the overall impact on potential output growth is hard to quantify.</p>, <p><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Hlk193386224\"></a><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The implementation of the reformed economic governance framework is surrounded by significant uncertainty.</strong> Although fiscal surveillance under the SGP framework is envisaged to continue to operate normally, it needs to take into account a coordinated activation of the national escape clause of the SGP. Such activation also follows a prolonged period (2020-23) in which the general escape clause of the SGP had already been activated, implying a de facto suspension of the European fiscal rules. In addition to challenges related to the escape clause, the uncertainty relates to the fact that some countries have yet to submit a plan or their plan lacks political backing. Moreover, future plans will need to rest on prior guidance from the European Commission based on more recent forecasts, factoring in recent shifts in the political and economic context. Overall, the course of fiscal policy in the euro area in 2025 and beyond remains surrounded by high uncertainty, not least as Member States still have to spell out their plans regarding defence. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">In view of high uncertainty, full implementation of the commitments undertaken in Member States’ MFSPs is crucial.</strong> As the SGP rules continue to be implemented, Member States should fully implement their fiscal and structural commitments as this will also help limit the deficit and debt-increasing impact of additional spending on defence. Fiscal consolidation measures need to be well-designed, and accompanied by growth-enhancing reforms and public investment, to limit adverse macroeconomic effects through aggregate demand. And the latter would in part be offset by confidence effects, notably in high-debt countries.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The national escape clause needs to be implemented in a targeted way, that ensures a rise in defence spending while preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability in line with the requirements of the SGP.</strong> In this context, it is essential that flexibility to deviate from an endorsed net expenditure path is only used for the necessary additional defence spending, as envisaged by the Commission in its Communication. This will be important to preserve the credibility of the recently reformed EU fiscal framework, thus achieving the defence spending goals without endangering medium-term fiscal sustainability. Deviations from the net expenditure paths should continue to be recorded in order to ensure normal surveillance of compliance with the commitments in the plans.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Appropriate surveillance and monitoring of fiscal adjustment, reform and investment commitments will be crucial to ensure that the objectives of the revised fiscal and economic governance framework are met.</strong> The framework builds on the premise that fiscal sustainability, reforms and investment are mutually reinforcing and should therefore be fostered as part of an integrated approach. ECB staff estimates suggest that gaps in the fiscal adjustment vis-à-vis the net expenditure ceilings of the MFSPs could emerge in the near term. Such gaps – if sizeable and persistent – may interfere with the objective of the new framework, namely putting debt on a plausibly declining path over the medium term, especially in view of the need for additional spending on defence. It is important that Member States do not use the flexibility offered by the control account ex ante, this being intended to be used to monitor deviations from agreed consolidation paths rather than provide additional fiscal space. Going forward, proper surveillance of the implementation of the plans will be crucial to ensure that the comprehensive new governance framework gains credibility and delivers on its stated objectives from the start.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Finally, the plan’s reform and investment initiatives will need to be implemented effectively.</strong> It will be essential to sustain national public investment, in line with the commitments contained in the MFSPs, in order to also address challenges in strategic areas other than defence, such as the green and digital transitions. Member States’ plans also contain important reform initiatives, which significantly overlap with or complement existing commitments under the Next Generation EU programme. The reforms and investments, if well implemented, can raise potential growth, thereby providing an important contribution to the sustainability of public finances. If anything, the most recent challenges that Europe has been confronted with have strengthened the case for stepping up efforts to bring about sustainably higher economic growth.</p>]\n"

Estimates of the additional amount that should be invested in capital expenditure and low carbon-emitting durable consumption goods each year until the end of this decade range from 2.7% to 3.7% of 2023 EU GDP. A delay in the decarbonisation, in particular at the global level, would push up transition and adaptation costs even further. At the same time, an investment-led transition towards a low-carbon economy will entail a wide-ranging structural shift, which is expected to affect growth and prices as well as the financial sector. For all these reasons, the ECB is carefully monitoring developments, as outlined in this article.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.2\" id=\"fn2\">2</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Substantial amounts of funds will be required for the green transition.</strong> To achieve the above aims, the contribution of the private sector to funding green investment will be key, also given current public finance constraints. While bank financing is expected to make a vital contribution to the green transition, capital markets in Europe will need to expand and integrate more fully to better support green innovation and start-ups. The public sector can play an important role in fostering private investment in the green transition by reducing the financing costs of borrowers and de-risking green investment activities, albeit within the bounds of the available fiscal space.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">A combination of structural reforms and good business conditions is crucial to underpin the green transition.</strong> Obstacles to the green transition include the limited availability of skilled staff in the field of clean and sustainable technologies, the challenges of setting up green businesses and uncertainty about future climate strategies. Public policies should aim to remove structural rigidities, improve regulatory and administrative efficiency and foster green innovation. Structural reforms can incentivise firms, households and investors to step up green investment activities.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Against this background, this article assesses the green investment needs in the EU and the ways that these can be financed.</strong> In Section 2, a range of estimates of green investment needs prepared by several institutions is assessed. Section 3 contains a discussion on the role of the private sector, especially banks, in financing the green transition, as well as the role of the public sector in supporting green investment. Section 4 reviews the main obstacles to the green transition and policy options to address them. Section 5 concludes.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.3\" id=\"fn3\">3</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Substantial investment is needed in the EU in the coming decades to enable the green transition, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</strong> Analysis by the European Commission shows that, in the period from 2011 to 2020, an average of €764 billion was invested in the EU each year to reduce GHG emissions (Chart 1, panel a). This is about 5.1% of the EU’s GDP in 2023. To reach the 2030 target, the Commission estimates that an additional €477 billion of green investment will be needed each year, equivalent to 3.2% of 2023 GDP.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.4\" id=\"fn4\">4</a>]</sup> In sum, total green investment of around €1.2 trillion each year, equivalent to 8.3% of 2023 GDP, is needed. The definition of green investment used here is broader than that used under gross fixed capital formation in national accounts, as it includes low carbon-emitting durable consumption goods such as electric vehicles. It is important to stress that a substantial part of this investment, as further discussed below, is not additional but rather substitution for investment goods and purchases of durable goods which are not considered “green”. For example, purchases of electric cars will substitute acquisitions of fuel combustion engine cars. The same applies to the installation of new domestic heating systems.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Estimates of green investment needs differ across institutions, both for total investment and the additional amounts needed.</strong> Compared with those of the European Commission, the figures for total green investment needs presented by other institutions are considerably smaller, mostly due to lower historical estimates (Chart 1, panel a). Focusing on the estimates of additional green investment needs − the amounts needed each year on top of continued investment of past amounts – these range between €558 billion according to BloombergNEF (BNEF) and around €400 billion according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Institute for Climate Economics (I4CE) until 2030. This implies that additional amounts of green investment between 2.7% and 3.7% of 2023 EU GDP will be needed each year until the end of this decade. As assessments of green investment needs involve a high degree of uncertainty, most studies rely on a variety of scenarios.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.5\" id=\"fn5\">5</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The variations can be attributed mainly to differences in the coverage and definition of the sectors as well as the underlying methodologies.</strong> The estimates vary depending on whether the full costs of green investments are considered or only the additional costs compared with legacy technologies. For example, the estimates for the transport sector by the European Commission and I4CE include the full production cost of electric vehicles, while the IEA only considers the battery costs. Moreover, estimates depend on the coverage and definition of the sectors included. BNEF and the IEA, for instance, include investments in hydrogen, nuclear and carbon capture, while only BNEF includes green investment in shipping. Furthermore, the estimated investment needed to increase the energy efficiency of buildings varies widely across institutions, and some institutions do not capture the building sector in their estimates.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Zooming in on the sectoral estimates, investment needs vary significantly across sectors.</strong> According to the European Commission, in absolute terms most investment is needed in the transport sector, with a total of €754 billion per year required for its transition towards carbon neutrality (Chart 1, panel b). By far the largest share, amounting to around 80%, relates to investment in road transport, which includes passenger transport and the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles but also goods transport. In relative terms, by contrast, the largest increase in green investment will be needed in clean energy supply. Compared with historical averages, investment in this sector will need to increase by a factor of around 1.7 annually until 2030 to decarbonise energy supply.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The estimates for additional green investment needs can be seen as a lower bound in view of investment shortfalls and the only selective coverage of sectors.</strong> Despite recent progress, Europe’s green investment activities have so far fallen short of what would have been needed annually until 2030 to achieve the decarbonisation target. Slippages were particularly noticeable during the pandemic. To compensate for the considerable shortfall compared with the target levels, more investment will be required in the remaining years to 2030.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.6\" id=\"fn6\">6</a>]</sup> If this is not achieved, a delay in the green transition would imply additional costs for adaptation.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.7\" id=\"fn7\">7</a>]</sup> Possible reasons for the shortfalls are poor access to, or high costs of, finance and a policy framework that fails to support, or even hinders, the green transition, as discussed below. Another reason why the estimates of annual investment may be understating the actual needs relates to the sectoral coverage. As mentioned above, some estimates do not include the full spectrum of sectors that will be impacted by the green transition. Taken together, this all means that the estimates outlined here should be considered a lower bound.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The green transition requires substantial funding, in particular by the private sector but with support from the public sector.</strong> This section looks at both of these sources of finance.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Banks are expected to play a crucial role in financing the green transition in the euro area.</strong> The green transition requires substantial amounts of funding, largely expected to be provided by the private sector. Given that loans from euro area banks account for nearly 60% of the stock of debt finance of euro area non-financial corporations and for more than 80% of the stock of debt of euro area households, banks make a key contribution to the financing of those activities that result in the release of carbon emissions.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.8\" id=\"fn8\">8</a>]</sup> Banks are therefore expected to play an important role in the financing of the green transition. The amount of carbon emitted by corporates in the euro area that can be linked to funding from euro area banks trended down overall from 2018 to 2021, but banks continued to be highly exposed to firms’ carbon emissions (Chart 2).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.9\" id=\"fn9\">9</a>]</sup> This exposure varies widely across industries, but is particularly large in the manufacturing, energy and transport sectors, which underscores the challenges these sectors still have ahead of them in the green transition.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Banks consider climate risks in their lending conditions, in terms of both transition and physical risks.</strong> In a specific climate-related question in the July 2024 <a class=\"link-inline arrow\" href=\"/stats/ecb_surveys/bank_lending_survey/html/ecb.blssurvey2024q2~f97cb321f1.en.html#toc22\">euro area bank lending survey</a> (BLS), banks reported that they grant a climate-related discount to firms with low carbon emissions and firms demonstrating considerable progress in their green transition (Chart 3, panel a). By contrast, high-emitting firms which may have so far postponed producing a credible green transition plan or have made little progress in that regard are charged a climate risk premium in their lending conditions. Banks may also reject a loan application if they have doubts regarding the sustainability of a firm’s business model or perceive a higher risk of corporate default in the medium term.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.10\" id=\"fn10\">10</a>]</sup> This demonstrates that banks recognise firms’ transition risk as a relevant credit risk leading to tighter credit conditions (Chart 3, panel b). In addition, the financing of investment in innovative green technologies typically entails higher credit risk, making their funding more costly. Banks also assess a firm’s physical risk, often linked to its geographic location, as a relevant risk in their climate-related credit assessment, as this can affect the value of collateral and the firm’s value more generally (blue bars in Chart 3, panel b). They expect the relevance of these climate-related risks to increase over time (yellow bars).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Climate-related fiscal support improves the likelihood of a loan being approved and mitigates the financing costs for firms, facilitating investment in the green transition.</strong> According to banks participating in the BLS, climate-related fiscal support, in the form of state guarantees or subsidies for example, can help to reduce banks’ exposure to climate risks, thereby easing credit conditions and helping to boost loan demand (Chart 3, panel b). However, banks indicated in the July 2024 BLS that the actual beneficial impact of climate-related fiscal support on bank lending conditions over the previous 12 months (blue bars) was substantially lower than they had expected a year earlier (yellow bars). The positive impact that fiscal support can have on firms’ green investment decisions is also confirmed by the firms themselves, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Meanwhile, large firms point in particular to the important role played by retained earnings as a source of funding for planned green investment, while capital markets still play a smaller role (Chart 4).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.11\" id=\"fn11\">11</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Financial markets can help to speed up the green transition, also by providing funding for riskier projects and green innovation, although these market segments are still small.</strong> Market-based financing involving the issuance of sustainable debt securities still plays only a limited role in the euro area, accounting for around 7% of the stock of all debt securities issued, with green bonds constituting the largest market segment (Chart 5).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.12\" id=\"fn12\">12</a>]</sup> While the market share of sustainable debt securities has grown rapidly over recent years, growth has slowed somewhat of late, especially for sustainability-linked bonds. Other market-based sources of funding, like private equity, play only a minor role in the EU.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.13\" id=\"fn13\">13</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Private funding needs to be supported by public sector action.</strong> Support from the public sector can come either directly in the form of public investment or indirectly in the form of subsidies or state guarantees. It can incentivise private green investment by reducing borrowers’ financing costs and de-risking green investment activities for firms and potential creditors alike. Helping the private sector to invest in the green transition can be particularly beneficial due to the high level of uncertainty surrounding the rate of return when financing innovation and new technologies. At the same, fiscal space for extensive public sector support is constrained by the requirement to preserve fiscal sustainability in Europe.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">At the EU level, public funds are supporting the green transition, with the largest contribution coming from the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).</strong> For the current EU budgetary period 2021-27, there is a requirement for at least 30% of the combined funds from the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme to contribute to climate objectives.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.14\" id=\"fn14\">14</a>]</sup> The RRF, which is the centrepiece of the NGEU programme, provides the largest share (€276 billion) of the total funds made available by the European Commission to support climate objectives (€658 billion; Chart 6, panel a).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.15\" id=\"fn15\">15</a>]</sup> Further public funds are provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB), by auction revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and by national policy initiatives.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The single largest share of the climate-related RRF funds goes to firms, but so far the absorption rate of these funds has been low (Chart 6, panel b).</strong> The support measures offered to firms, amounting to 43% of the climate-related RRF funds, come mostly in the form of subsidies and tax credits which aim to promote green investments in areas such as energy infrastructure, company electric vehicles and greater building energy efficiency. So far, however, the absorption rate of these funds has generally been low.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.16\" id=\"fn16\">16</a>]</sup> By mid-2024 only 20% (around €55 billion) of the climate-related RRF funds had been disbursed, with the remainder still available to be spent until the end of 2026. The low absorption rate may be partly related to bottlenecks caused by insufficient administrative capacity and complex governance structures. The performance-based nature of the RRF means that financial support is not provided until pre-defined milestones and targets have been met. By contrast, as much as 40% (around €150 billion) of the climate-related funds committed under the current MFF had been disbursed by the end of 2023.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The available EU funds can largely cover the public green investment needs up to 2026, although a green public funding gap may open up when the RRF expires.</strong> No benchmark has been established yet to determine the optimal role of the public sector in mitigating climate change. That said, a broad estimate of the public share of the additional investment needs may be derived from the weighted public investment share of each sector.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.17\" id=\"fn17\">17</a>]</sup> This stylised exercise results in an overall public sector share of around 17% of the additional climate-related investment needs over the period from 2021 to 2030, which is equivalent to around €83 billion per year.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.18\" id=\"fn18\">18</a>]</sup> Compared with the available EU funds and under the assumption of full disbursement of the RRF funds by the end of 2026, the green public funding gap would be limited to an average of €20 billion per year (around 24% of the public funding needs) between 2025 and 2030. This result is sensitive to the underlying assumptions, however, especially the full use of the RRF envelope. The green public funding gap is likely to become substantially larger after the RRF expires at the end of 2026 (green bars in Chart 6, panel b). Yet, limited EU public funds after 2026 may reduce the ability of the public sector to crowd in private investment.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.19\" id=\"fn19\">19</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Structural reforms will also play an important role in supporting the transition to a climate-neutral economy.</strong> The green transition requires an institutional framework and structural reforms that facilitate the reallocation of resources from high-carbon to low-carbon activities, incentivise green innovation and new business models, and provide a favourable environment for the deployment and diffusion of low-carbon technologies.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">However, a recent survey by the European Patent Office (EPO) and the EIB revealed major structural barriers to green investment, with for instance the availability of finance being more problematic here than for investing firms in general.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.20\" id=\"fn20\">20</a>]</sup> Around 30% of cleantech firms stated that issues with the availability of finance acted as a major obstacle to investment.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.21\" id=\"fn21\">21</a>]</sup> This is twice the share reported by the broader range of non-financial firms surveyed in the wider EIB Investment Survey (Chart 7).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.22\" id=\"fn22\">22</a>]</sup> Skill shortages and regulatory barriers including complex and diverse regulations across the EU are major challenges for firms. Other bottlenecks include difficulties in finding demand for new products and services, as well as the high cost and complexity of finding and negotiating with business partners. Policies to improve the quality of education, upskilling and reskilling of the labour force as well as to spur labour mobility to green sectors are key to support green investment.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.23\" id=\"fn23\">23</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The recently published report authored by Mario Draghi highlights the key role that simplifying and harmonising regulations at national and EU levels can play in supporting innovation and the scaling-up of EU firms.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.24\" id=\"fn24\">24</a>]</sup> This could be achieved by creating a European Innovative Company (EIC) label, for instance, under which EU companies would be able to operate under a limited and harmonised set of legal obligations covering corporate law, insolvency procedures and some key aspects of labour and tax law.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.25\" id=\"fn25\">25</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Carbon taxation, which is widely seen as the most efficient policy instrument to incentivise private investment in the green transition, is expected to increase.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.26\" id=\"fn26\">26</a>]</sup> In Europe, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) works indirectly as a carbon tax, with the carbon price being determined by auctions of emission permits. A new EU ETS2 will be introduced in 2027 to cover emissions from building heating and transport.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.27\" id=\"fn27\">27</a>]</sup> In addition, several EU Member States have explicit carbon taxes in place, though often with a limited tax base and rate. The effective carbon rate, which combines EU ETS prices, actual carbon taxes and fuel excise taxes, is still well below the effective carbon rate that would be needed to achieve the 2030 emission reduction target in the absence of other measures.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.28\" id=\"fn28\">28</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Finally, it is vital to advance the capital markets union agenda, also for the green transition.</strong> More sophisticated venture capital markets would make it easier for innovative EU firms to access risk capital and to grow. In addition, well-designed savings products would help to channel European savings towards longer-term, higher-return investments.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.29\" id=\"fn29\">29</a>]</sup> In particular, patents are important to attract venture capital and serve as debt collateral.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.30\" id=\"fn30\">30</a>]</sup> Capital market imperfections such as asymmetric information may discourage investors from channelling funds towards green research and development. Patents can mitigate such financing constraints by sending important signals when the prospects of young companies are being assessed.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.31\" id=\"fn31\">31</a>]</sup> To improve its role in cleantech innovation, it is essential for Europe to reap the full benefits of the Single Market and tackle regulatory fragmentation.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">In this article we look at the green investment needs in the EU to 2030, how they are funded and policy options that would support the green transition.</strong> A key message is that the green investment needed in the EU in addition to what has already been spent is substantial, up to 3.7% of 2023 GDP annually. Moreover, banks – which play a key role in the financing of the euro area economy – have started to reflect climate risks in their lending. By contrast, green financing via financial markets − ranging from green bonds to venture capital − is growing but is still at a low level. The public sector can play an important role in crowding in private investment and mobilising more private funding for green investment. A significant green public funding gap is, however, expected to emerge as of 2027 following the expiry of the RRF. Furthermore, structural policies are essential to support green investment and innovation in green technologies, while a shortage of green skills and a high regulatory burden are seen as obstacles. Finally, it will be a challenge to fund the massive green investment needs, in part due to shortfalls that have already taken place and the expected green public funding gap after the RRF expires. Further progress towards more integrated European capital markets appears crucial to mobilise private funding sources beyond bank lending.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Looking beyond the 2030 green transition horizon, available estimates point to even higher investment needs to reach the goal of carbon neutrality</strong>.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.32\" id=\"fn32\">32</a>]</sup> While associated with even greater uncertainty than the estimates presented here, estimates of investment needs beyond this decade suggest a need to further accelerate green investment activities at both the national and the EU level. Moreover, adaptation investment may turn out to be sizeable, in particular if the effects of climate change become more pervasive.</p>]\n",

      "[<p class=\"ecb-authors\">Prepared by Pablo Anaya Longaric, Alessandro De Sanctis, Charlotte Grynberg, Vasileios Kostakis and Francesca Vinci</p>, <p>Published as part of the <a class=\"link-inline arrow\" href=\"/press/economic-bulletin/html/eb202408.en.html\">ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 8/2024</a>.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The surge in energy prices following the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine exposed the EU to the largest energy shock since the 1970s.</strong> As a key input in virtually any production process, the sharp rise in energy prices not only contributed to a surge in inflation and a loss of purchasing power for households but also to a significant increase in input costs, with ripple effects across all economic sectors.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Shocks that increase the cost of energy can negatively influence economic dynamics not only in the short run but also in the medium to long run through the investment channel. </strong>In the short term, higher input costs put downward pressure on production.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.1\" id=\"fn1\">1</a>]</sup> This can also result in lower investment, with negative consequences for productivity growth in the long term.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.2\" id=\"fn2\">2</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The economic literature has long identified the importance of investment for productivity.</strong> Corporate investment, especially in fixed capital and research and development (R&amp;D), is at the heart of productivity growth, which is in turn directly linked to the ability of firms to compete in international markets.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.3\" id=\"fn3\">3</a>]</sup> Productivity improvements reduce the cost of production per unit of output, allowing firms to lower prices and/or increase profit margins. Productivity increases can also enhance export competitiveness, as more productive firms are better positioned to capture and expand their market share.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.4\" id=\"fn4\">4</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Energy shocks can also dampen a country’s competitiveness through their negative impact on investment and productivity. </strong>Following a positive shock to energy costs, compressed profit margins (especially for energy-intensive firms), subdued economic activity, heightened uncertainty and, in some cases, tighter financing conditions may reduce investment by firms, paving the way for future competitiveness losses.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.5\" id=\"fn5\">5</a>]</sup> This may occur particularly when producers are unable to fully pass on the cost increases to consumers, for instance due to a high price elasticity of demand.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.6\" id=\"fn6\">6</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">However, energy shocks can also incentivise firms to invest in energy generation and energy-saving projects.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.7\" id=\"fn7\">7</a>]</sup> Recent surveys indicate that firms are adapting to the evolving energy landscape by reducing their dependence on traditional energy sources in order to shelter against future energy shocks and secure competitive advantages.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.8\" id=\"fn8\">8</a>]</sup> These efforts to reduce the energy bill can lead to an increase in green investment, which can mitigate the overall impact of energy shocks on total investment. However, despite their potential to mitigate future energy shocks (and to reduce future energy prices), green investments may also be adversely affected by the direct and indirect consequences of an increase in energy prices.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.9\" id=\"fn9\">9</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">This article explores how energy shocks influence investment by European firms, focusing on fixed capital and R&amp;D expenditure.</strong> Empirical analysis shows that energy shocks can have a negative impact on corporate investment and thus, potentially, undermine European productivity growth and future competitiveness. The analysis also shows that financially constrained firms and firms in energy-intensive sectors are more affected by energy shocks and respond by cutting investment more than other firms.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">From a policy perspective, both national and EU measures are needed to reduce the exposure of the EU to future energy shocks.</strong> Further integration of European energy markets and progress in the green transition would contribute to reducing energy prices and strengthening energy supply, making the EU less vulnerable to adverse energy price developments.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The main energy sources used in production in the EU are electricity and natural gas, together with oil and petroleum products.</strong> Electricity and natural gas are key inputs, each making up around a third of the EU’s industrial energy mix. These are followed by “oil and petroleum products” and “renewables and biofuels” at 11% each (Chart 1, panel a).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.10\" id=\"fn10\">10</a>]</sup> The industrial energy mix has remained largely unchanged over the past 15 years. When considering the energy landscape in which industry operates, it is also relevant to consider how the consumed electricity is generated, as this has a significant impact on its price. While the share of renewables in the EU electricity generation mix is growing, natural gas and other fossil fuels still play an important role (Chart 1, panel b), indirectly increasing their importance in the energy supply of firms.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Due to the marginal pricing system, the price of electricity is closely linked to fossil fuels.</strong> Electricity prices in short-term markets are determined by the most expensive facility used to generate electricity at any given point in time. In the EU, gas-fired power plants are typically the most expensive way of generating electricity, followed by coal, lignite and nuclear power. Renewables are typically the cheapest, as their variable costs are close to zero. A consequence of this mechanism is that gas often acts as the price-setter even though it generates a relatively low share of the EU’s electricity. According to the European Commission, in 2022 gas-fired power plants generated 19% of the EU’s electricity but set the price 55% of the time.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.11\" id=\"fn11\">11</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Wholesale energy prices in the EU began rising significantly in the second half of 2021.</strong> As the EU imports nearly all the oil and gas it consumes, it is strongly exposed to price fluctuations in global markets, which can be affected by geopolitical developments and production decisions outside of the EU. Wholesale oil and gas prices started to go up in the second half of 2021, in part because of the recovery in economic activity following the pandemic and in part due to constraints in the supply of oil and gas. This was exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which drove up gas and oil prices further.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.12\" id=\"fn12\">12</a>]</sup> High gas prices had, in turn, a knock-on effect on electricity prices due to the marginal pricing system.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The spike in wholesale prices had a strong impact on the price of energy for EU industry.</strong> Wholesale prices are not transmitted perfectly to retail prices, as the latter are also influenced by factors such as taxation, regulatory frameworks, infrastructure availability, the electricity generation mix and contract structures. From 2021 onwards, many public policy measures were also taken to cushion energy shocks. Nevertheless, Chart 2 shows that the increase in wholesale prices was strongly transmitted to the retail prices paid by EU firms for electricity, natural gas and diesel. This had a significant impact on their production costs, with the producer price index for energy (PPI energy) more than doubling between 2020 and 2022.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">These developments spurred an intense policy debate about the EU’s dependence on imported energy and on the implications for its competitiveness in the face of energy shocks.</strong><sup><strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.13\" id=\"fn13\">13</a>]</sup></strong></sup> The EU relies significantly on imported energy and is thus more exposed to energy shocks than other major economies, such as the United States.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.14\" id=\"fn14\">14</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">While quantifying the effects of energy shocks on investment decisions is challenging, owing to the multitude of transmission channels as well as data limitations, exploring historical patterns can provide useful insights.</strong> To pin down the effect of energy shocks on investment, this article employs balance sheet data on publicly listed firms from Standard &amp; Poor’s Compustat for the period 1999-2022 and estimates the response of fixed capital and R&amp;D investment using local projections.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.15\" id=\"fn15\">15</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Energy shocks can originate from different energy sources, and correctly identifying them is a major challenge.</strong> The energy crisis of 2022 was triggered by the disruption of natural gas supplies in Europe, which led to an increase in fossil fuel and electricity prices. However, given the historical importance of oil shocks, these have attracted more attention from academic literature than gas shocks, resulting in only a few reliable and readily available measures for the latter.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.16\" id=\"fn16\">16</a>]</sup> Furthermore, oil accounts for a significant share of energy consumed by the EU industrial sector, and prices of other energy sources, such as gas, are influenced by oil prices. Oil shocks can therefore be a good proxy for energy shocks, albeit with some caveats.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.17\" id=\"fn17\">17</a>]</sup> One of the most recent methods for identifying and measuring oil shocks concerns oil supply news shocks.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.18\" id=\"fn18\">18</a>]</sup> These shocks capture shifts in expectations about future oil production and prices rather than immediate disruptions, making them particularly relevant for investment decisions.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.19\" id=\"fn19\">19</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Oil supply news shocks increase energy prices and reduce aggregate investment.</strong> As shown in Chart 3, an oil supply news shock leads to a contemporaneous increase of 7% in oil prices and of 1% in PPI energy.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.20\" id=\"fn20\">20</a>]</sup> Moreover, total gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) declines immediately after the shock, reaching a trough of -1.5% after two years. Investment in intellectual property products (IPP), which includes R&amp;D, also decreases by 1% two years after the shock.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.21\" id=\"fn21\">21</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Consistent with the aggregate evidence, firm-level analysis based on publicly listed firms shows that oil supply news shocks exert downward pressure on investment.</strong><sup><strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.22\" id=\"fn22\">22</a>]</sup></strong></sup> As shown in panel a) of Chart 4, following an oil supply news shock that increases PPI energy by 1%, capital expenditure of publicly listed firms decreases by 2.9% on impact and 4.1% after one year.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.23\" id=\"fn23\">23</a>]</sup> R&amp;D expenditure displays a smaller decline of around 0.85% both on impact and one year after the oil shock (Chart 4, panel b). Compared to the aggregate analysis, firm-level results show a larger impact of the shocks on capital expenditure and a similar impact on R&amp;D expenditure. A possible explanation for this discrepancy lies in the sample coverage. In the Compustat sample analysed, R&amp;D expenditure accounts for approximately 60% of aggregate R&amp;D spending on average during the sample period. In contrast, the sample coverage for capital expenditure is only around 20%. This suggests that the firm-level R&amp;D response is likely to be more aligned with the aggregate results than the capital expenditure response. However, the exact nature of the difference in terms of capital expenditure is not known beforehand, meaning that the response could be either larger or smaller than the aggregate result. Examining the sectoral coverage reveals that energy-intensive firms are represented more in the firm-level sample than in the aggregated data. Specifically, the capital expenditure of energy-intensive firms makes up about 40% of total capital expenditure in the Compustat sample, whereas it only accounts for 12% in the aggregate data.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.24\" id=\"fn24\">24</a>]</sup> To the extent that energy-intensive firms are more susceptible to energy shocks and hence reduce investment more than non-energy-intensive firms, the firm-level results are consistent with the aggregate findings. This is discussed in more detail in the next paragraph.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The role played by energy intensity warrants consideration because energy-intensive industries (EIIs) are particularly vulnerable to energy shocks owing to their energy needs.</strong> EIIs include sectors such as chemicals, metals, cement and glass and account for about 45% of electricity, gas and oil used by EU industries, despite representing less than 4% of EU gross value added in 2021.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.25\" id=\"fn25\">25</a>]</sup> These provide key materials for industries such as construction, the automotive industry and electronics and are important suppliers to sectors driving the green and digital transitions.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.26\" id=\"fn26\">26</a>]</sup> As a result, these are pivotal both to the EU’s decarbonisation goals and to its open strategic autonomy. However, European EIIs are burdened with electricity prices that are significantly higher than in some other economies, such as the United States, resulting in a competitive disadvantage.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.27\" id=\"fn27\">27</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Financial constraints also play an important role in the investment decisions of firms.</strong> Financing conditions have long been recognised in the academic literature as critical enablers of investment, significantly influencing firms’ capacity to respond to shocks.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.28\" id=\"fn28\">28</a>]</sup> Survey evidence further indicates that financial constraints frequently emerge as major barriers to investment, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.29\" id=\"fn29\">29</a>]</sup> Measuring financing constraints is challenging, as there is no agreed definition, but balance sheet data can be used to construct relevant estimates. The literature indicates that firms with relatively high debt (defined as a leverage ratio higher than the sample median) that are also of young age can be considered financially constrained.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.30\" id=\"fn30\">30</a>]</sup> High leverage constrains financing because firms with significant debt can be considered riskier, which leads to higher borrowing costs and stricter financing terms, while being a young firm compounds this constraint, as younger firms may lack established credit histories, collateral and proven revenue streams, making lenders more cautious when lending to them and thus limiting the availability of affordable external financing. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The joint occurrence of high energy intensity and financing constraints can amplify the effects of energy shocks.</strong> Recent survey data suggest that firms that self-identify as financially constrained are more likely to consider increases in energy costs as an impediment to investment than their non-financially constrained counterparts.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.31\" id=\"fn31\">31</a>]</sup> Empirical analysis reveals that financially constrained firms in energy-intensive sectors consistently reduce investment more sharply than other firms after an oil shock. Chart 5 shows the effect on firms, grouped according to energy intensity and financial constraints, of an oil supply news shock that raises PPI energy by 1% on impact. The analysis reveals that all groups reduce investment, but being in an energy-intensive sector and being financially constrained amplifies the impact of the shock on both capital and R&amp;D expenditure.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.32\" id=\"fn32\">32</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The evidence presented in this article suggests that energy shocks tend to decrease investment and innovation in Europe, especially for financially constrained firms in energy-intensive sectors.</strong> Publicly listed firms in the EU reduce investment in response to energy shocks (as proxied by oil shocks). Empirical analysis indicates that a 1% increase in energy prices driven by oil shocks leads to a significant decrease in fixed capital expenditure (-4.1% after one year), while R&amp;D spending drops by almost 1%, showing a more muted impact. Moreover, firms that are financially constrained and energy-intensive experience sharper reductions in investment following an oil price increase.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">These findings are in line with a broad body of literature documenting the negative macroeconomic effects of oil shocks and confirm the importance of reducing the EU’s vulnerability to such shocks.</strong> The EU is heavily reliant on imported energy, making it more exposed to energy shocks than other major economies. As energy shocks put downward pressure on investment, and to the extent that investment slowdowns can lead to a decline in productivity, the EU is at risk of gradually losing competitiveness. This may threaten not only current but also future prosperity.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.33\" id=\"fn33\">33</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Policy measures at both national and European level should therefore aim to secure the energy supply of the EU, lower energy prices and mitigate the exposure of firms to future energy shocks.</strong> While national interventions are best suited to address country-specific issues, EU actions should be aimed at tackling shared problems and fostering cross-country collaboration. The Draghi and Letta reports contain several proposals to address these issues.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.34\" id=\"fn34\">34</a>]</sup> These include strengthening joint procurement of gas imports to increase the EU’s market power and expanding the use of long-term electricity contracts. The two reports also emphasise that accelerating and simplifying permitting processes, channelling EU funds, and promoting cross-border projects to boost renewable energy production would enhance energy security and reduce energy prices in the medium term. Moreover, the Draghi report suggests targeted support measures for EIIs to ensure they remain competitive while contributing to decarbonisation. Finally, advancing the capital markets union could help ease financing constraints for firms, enabling them to invest in improving their energy efficiency. Together, these measures would have the potential to strengthen the resilience of the EU to future shocks and increase its long-term competitiveness.</p>]\n",

To achieve these objectives, the programme offers financial support to EU Member States on the condition that they implement specified investment and reform projects over the period 2021-2026. Earlier ECB staff analysis concluded that NGEU had the potential to deliver these objectives, provided that the planned investments and reforms were implemented in good time and effectively.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.1\" id=\"fn1\">1</a>]</sup> Now, more than halfway into the implementation period of NGEU, this article provides a description of the situation to date, as well as an updated assessment of the economic impact of the programme. It focuses on the impact of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) – the centrepiece of NGEU – on the euro area economy. Among euro area countries, particular attention is paid to Italy and Spain as the main recipients of RRF funds in absolute terms.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The original budget set aside to fund NGEU was more than €800 billion for the whole EU.</strong> Among the several programmes initiated under NGEU, the RRF was by far the largest, accounting for almost €724 billion, around 90% of the total envelope. Under the RRF, funding was made available to EU Member States in the form of grants (up to €338 billion) and loans (up to nearly €386 billion).</p>, <p>EU Member States <strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">have since applied for €650 billion in RRF funds.</strong> While all of them requested the RRF grants in full, several chose not to apply for RRF loans, or requested less than they were entitled to ask for by the deadline of August 2023. Moreover, the envelope itself was subsequently revised.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.2\" id=\"fn2\">2</a>]</sup> As a result of updated national recovery and resilience plans (RRPs) and the updated total envelope, EU countries had applied for €650 billion in RRF funds as at 26 August 2024. This equals 4.6% of 2019 EU gross domestic product (GDP). Additionally, Member States are entitled to €83 billion (0.6% of 2019 EU GDP) in funds from other programmes under NGEU. It should be pointed out that although the size of NGEU disbursements to Member States has increased significantly, this is in part offset by an erosion caused by the unanticipated inflationary shock which occurred after the inception of the programme. In the case of investment financing grants, which are the most relevant in terms of the stimulative macro effect, the nominal increase (around 10% to euro area countries) means that the real value is broadly maintained.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Focusing on the euro area, member countries are entitled to use RRF funds of up to €532 billion, that is, 82% of the EU total of €650 billion.</strong> Out of this amount, it is estimated that a little less – €486 billion – will actually be spent.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.3\" id=\"fn3\">3</a>]</sup> It is on the basis of this latter figure – almost half a trillion euro in RRF-funded public expenditure – that this article builds estimates of the macroeconomic impact of the RRF on the euro area via the fiscal channel.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">In order to disburse these funds to EU Member States, at the time of drafting this article the Commission had already borrowed more than €320 billion.</strong> Out of this amount, €265.4 billion were paid to the Member States after their satisfactory fulfilment of the qualitative milestones and quantitative targets related to the completion of the reforms and investments associated with each tranche of the RRF. This means that, at that time, around 60% of RRF grants and loans still had to be paid to the EU Member States (50% for euro area countries).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The implementation of the RRF allowed for joint borrowing and risk sharing among Member States.</strong> This is particularly the case for the grant component. As the grants are intended to be repaid through the EU budget, these do not add to the national debt. However, this does not mean it is a cost-free measure for Member States as a group. While repayment risks are minimal owing to the budgetary safeguards in place, the burden of repayment will ultimately fall almost entirely on Member States. The incidence and distribution of this burden across countries remains uncertain.</p>, <p><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181087360\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181087438\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181201266\"></a><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">NGEU borrowing and repayment<br/><br/>With the implementation of NGEU, the volume of the European Commission’s issuance to international capital markets markedly increased.</strong> While the Commission’s issuance on behalf of the European Union to finance EU policy programmes had previously been limited, between January 2020 and May 2024 its net issuance reached almost €500 billion, primarily for NGEU. This surpassed issuances by other EU entities, including the European Stability Mechanism and the European Investment Bank. This large-scale borrowing will continue until the end of 2026 at the latest, with an approximate estimate of €150 billion in issuances per year. In accordance with the Own Resources Decision<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.4\" id=\"fn4\">4</a>]</sup>, after 2026 the Commission will not be able to conduct new net borrowing. However, it does have the leeway to shift to regular liquidity management operations and debt roll-over, aiming to smooth the schedule for repayment of EU borrowing allocated to NGEU until 31 December 2058 at the latest.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The loans will be repaid by the borrowing Member States and the grant component of NGEU will be financed through the EU budget, with budgetary safeguards in place to mitigate risks on future repayments.</strong> In particular, the Member States have committed to ensuring that the budget of the Commission will have enough funds to repay the grants. The refinancing is guaranteed by the temporary “budgetary headroom”, that is, the commitment by Member States of up to 0.6% of gross national income (GNI) designed to ensure that the EU can meet its commitments towards investors. In addition, the Commission has proposed to raise an additional 0.2% of GNI through a mix of traditional EU revenues and additional transfers. However, it is still uncertain whether the Council of the European Union will approve the proposal.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">While we do not foresee material repayment risk arising from NGEU borrowing, the financial burden will ultimately fall on EU Member States, which should account for it in their medium-term plans.</strong> Assuming that the Commission will use the available leeway to ensure a steady and predictable reduction of liabilities, we estimate that the annual repayment cost of the grant component of the RRF will peak at €26 billion in 2028 and steadily fall thereafter. Repayments remain well below the temporary budgetary headroom and could be fully covered through either new EU own resources or higher GNI-based contributions, both of which are sufficient in size. Regardless of the agreement on the Commission’s proposal, repayment will largely rely on national transfers to the EU budget, potentially leading to higher taxes or constraints on investments. Nevertheless, there are country-specific risks, with each option having diverse distributional effects.</p>, <p><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181087362\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181087440\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181201267\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181270897\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Hlk180659248\"></a><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">RRF payments to Member States<br/></strong><br/><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">By August 2024, RRF payments of over €238 billion had been made, €156 billion of which were in the form of grants.</strong> These payments to Member States followed 45 finalised payment requests to the Commission. In addition, eight further requests had been submitted but not yet finalised at that point in time (Table 1 shows evidence for the euro area, non-euro area and the whole EU).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">RRF-funded expenditure in the euro area<br/></strong><br/><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The composition of RRF expenditure across euro area countries varies greatly both in terms of the share of national GDP and the share of total euro area GDP (Chart 1).</strong> Some differences can also be observed in terms of distribution of the spending categories within countries, although government capital spending – the sum of government investment and government capital transfers – accounts for the bulk of expenditure in nearly all countries.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">A large part of the RRF expenditure aims to support the green and digital transitions.</strong> In line with the NGEU legislation, countries need to commit at least 37% of expenditure under the RRF to green projects and 20% to digital projects. Yet the actual amounts of RRF funds that euro area countries have committed to spending on those two objectives by end-2026 significantly exceed these targets. According to the Commission, the commitments reach on average 42% (green spending) and 27% (digital spending) of total RRF funds. Contributions of national plans to the climate and digital objectives are heterogenous across euro area countries.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">On average, fiscal experts within the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) estimate that around 80% of RRF-based expenditure in the euro area is additive in nature.</strong> In other words, this share of expenditure provides a genuine fiscal stimulus rather than a substitute for already planned expenditure. This is the basis for the macroeconomic estimates in this article.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">RRF expenditure is heavily backloaded to the second half of the programme, with clear implications for the assessment of macroeconomic impact.</strong> In each of the years between 2021 and 2023, there was significant under-execution of RRF-funded expenditure in most euro area countries when compared with their original plans (Chart 2). The pattern is observed for both relatively high and low funding recipients. This is mainly because of (i) limits to the administrative capacity to spend; and (ii) a sequence of shocks which resulted in supply-side bottlenecks and downscaling of procurement contracts because of higher-than-expected inflation.<strong class=\"intense-emphasis\"> </strong>As a result, ECB staff estimate that in 2021-2023 the RRF increased the level of euro area GDP by 0.1 to 0.2% only (see Section 3). This is much lower than the previously estimated effect of around 0.5%, which assumed swift and full implementation of the original plans in the absence of the inflation surge.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Structural reforms are an essential part of RRPs and complement RRF-linked investments.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.5\" id=\"fn5\">5</a>]</sup> The planned reforms aim to modernise the euro area economies and increase their resilience over the medium term. To this end, the RRF regulation requires that the reforms be tailored to Member States’ structural weaknesses, commensurate with the size of the individual RRF envelopes and complementary to RRF-financed public expenditure. The reforms also support institutional and economic convergence across euro area countries, since the initial framework conditions in the countries with the most comprehensive RRF-linked reform plans were generally weaker than in many peer countries. Recent RRP modifications have left the overall balance of reforms and investments broadly unchanged compared with the initial plans (with reforms accounting for 40% of all milestones and targets), but planned reforms have become “greener” and less frontloaded overall.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Although the implementation of RRF-linked structural reforms has progressed, significant delays in RRP implementation have materialised.</strong> By early September 2024 euro area countries had fulfilled around 40% of all milestones and targets in relation to structural reforms, according to the European Commission’s assessment. Even so, only around one third of all envisaged payment requests had been submitted by that time. This falls short of the indicative timetable included in the RRPs, according to which around one half of all planned payment requests should have been submitted by then (Chart 3). Euro area countries featuring a combination of relatively weak administrative capacity and a large RRF allocation have recorded the longest RRP implementation delays overall.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Many euro area countries still need to fulfil most or even all of their RRF-linked reform commitments.</strong> Although the RRF has already entered the second half of its envisaged lifespan, the share of reform-related milestones and targets already assessed and deemed to have been fulfilled by the Commission is well below 50% in many euro area countries (Chart 4). All milestones and targets will need to be completed by 31 August 2026 at the latest according to the RRF regulation. Only a few countries have already been assessed and deemed by the Commission to have implemented more than 50% of their reform-related milestones and targets.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">In view of these challenges, there is a risk that the effectiveness of RRFs will be diminished by incomplete or ineffective implementation.</strong> Incomplete implementation could arise if Member States were to implement only a subset of the agreed policy measures by August 2026. The 2024 country-specific recommendations issued under the European Semester therefore call on many Member States to accelerate the implementation of their RRPs. However, speeding up implementation of the plans is not sufficient for the RRF to achieve its full potential. Member States will need to ensure that speed does not come at the expense of the quality of measures implemented. If a trade-off between speed and quality were to emerge, prioritising quality over speed would help ensure the effectiveness of the reforms.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">By taking targeted policy action, euro area countries can ensure that NGEU-linked investments and reforms are implemented more effectively.</strong> Member States could redirect administrative resources towards implementing their RRPs and make more intensive use of available technical support at EU level. In addition, they could take advantage of the streamlining options offered by the European Commission’s updated RRP guidance, which include simplified reporting requirements and synergies between different audit procedures.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.6\" id=\"fn6\">6</a>]</sup> Member States could also seek to identify targeted regulatory changes outside the RRF framework; this would facilitate the roll-out of the RRPs without overly absorbing administrative resources.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.7\" id=\"fn7\">7</a>]</sup> Overall, such corrective policy measures would help improve reform implementation under the RRPs and might even alleviate any emerging trade-off between the speed and quality of RRP implementation.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Assessing how NGEU affects the euro area economy involves examining multiple transmission channels.</strong> Building on previous analyses, we will consider three primary channels: (i) the risk premium channel; (ii) the fiscal channel; and (iii) the structural reform channel. Given significant implementation delays, the fiscal and structural reform channels warrant re-evaluation.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The risk-premia effects that followed the announcement of NGEU continue to benefit recipient countries.</strong> The period following the Franco-German recovery fund proposal was marked by notable spread compression among beneficiaries. Bańkowski et al. (2022) concluded that a sustained reduction in risk premia could permanently increase euro area output by up to 0.2%, with Italy and Spain experiencing the most substantial benefits. We have refrained from updating this evaluation, as no significant developments warranting reassessment have occurred since then.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The fiscal channel operates through increased public expenditure, primarily directed toward capital expenditure through government investment and capital transfers.</strong> For analytical purposes, both categories are treated as government investment, as NGEU-induced capital transfers are typically dedicated to private entities, such as railway companies, that are executing projects similar to public investment. The economic impact manifests through short-term demand stimulus during execution and long-term productive capacity enhancement through capital stock increases.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.8\" id=\"fn8\">8</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The structural reform channel, crucial for long-term economic potential, needs to be reassessed owing to implementation delays.</strong> These reforms boost potential output by improving the efficiency of resource utilisation. As the reforms extend beyond cyclical factors, they are not expected to have a direct impact on inflation – as a result, this study focuses primarily on output effects. However, the uncertainty inherent in quantifying structural reforms warrants caution when interpreting estimates.</p>, <p><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc455575522\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc461633199\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc461637804\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Ref176961189\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc179362903\"></a><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The analysis of the economic impact of NGEU makes use of two large-scale macroeconomic models: the ESCB’s public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) tool and input from a Eurosystem expert group.</strong> Applying multiple approaches in this study allows us to tailor methodologies to address the key questions. The use of two different types of macroeconomic model also makes the results more robust and enables us to highlight the specific channels driving particular economic outcomes.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The macroeconomic effects of the fiscal channel are assessed using the EAGLE and the ECB-MC model.</strong> EAGLE (euro area and global economy) is a global dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with forward-looking expectations, while the ECB-MC (multi-country) model is a semi-structural model of the five largest euro area countries which balances empirical fit with theoretical foundations.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.9\" id=\"fn9\">9</a>]</sup> Both models demonstrate fiscal multipliers for government investment of approximately unity, aligning with literature that identifies public investment as a potent fiscal instrument owing to its direct impact on GDP and enhancement of productive capital. However, the models exhibit important differences in their expectation mechanisms: EAGLE’s forward-looking approach enables prominent anticipation effects, while ECB-MC’s backward-looking expectations largely preclude such effects, leading to distinct simulated outcomes, especially when it comes to price dynamics.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The analysis is complemented by two additional tools which shed light on potential output and debt-to-GDP ratio effects.</strong> A Eurosystem expert group made up of staff from seven euro area central banks has provided an assessment of NGEU’s impact on euro area potential output, considering both reforms and investments across all NGEU instruments. Furthermore, the DSA tool estimates NGEU’s impact on government debt-to-GDP ratios through a detailed decomposition of debt dynamics.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.10\" id=\"fn10\">10</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The quantification of the fiscal impact of RRF-funded expenditures relies on data collected by ESCB experts.</strong> The data captures essential programme characteristics, including composition, implementation timeline and the distinction between additive and substitutive projects. Differentiation along the last dimension is crucial for identifying projects that would have occurred independently of the programme, thus preventing overestimation of macroeconomic effects.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The quantification is based on scenario analysis across two key dimensions: fund absorption rates and public capital productivity.</strong> For absorption, we consider both full absorption by 2026 and an alternative scenario maintaining the observed 50% absorption rate, reflecting implementation challenges (Chart 5, panels a) and b). Regarding productivity, the baseline assumes a Cobb-Douglas production function parameter of 0.1 for public capital in EAGLE, with alternative scenarios of 0.05 and 0.15, while ECB-MC treats public and private capital as equally productive.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.11\" id=\"fn11\">11</a>]</sup> In practical terms, these different productivity parameters determine how effectively public capital translates into economic output: a higher parameter of 0.15 generates stronger economic benefits, while a lower value of 0.05 implies more modest returns from public spending.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Our study finds that the NGEU programme could deliver substantial macroeconomic benefits for the euro area through various transmission channels.</strong> This section distinguishes between the impact on output and inflation via the fiscal channel, potential output gains from structural reforms and implications for the debt-to-GDP ratio.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The impact of the programme on the level of GDP is estimated to range between 0.4% and 0.9% above the non-programme baseline by 2026, with gains increasing to 0.8-1.2% up to 2031 (Table 2).</strong> This trajectory reflects two main drivers: initial gains due to the fiscal stimulus, followed by growth-enhancing effects created by structural reforms. The increase in benefits over time primarily stems from the growing returns of structural reforms, even as NGEU spending effects diminish. However, structural reform channel effects carry greater uncertainty than fiscal channel impacts. The output estimates exclude both the already-realised confidence effects stemming from the programme’s announcement and the minimal expected impact of private sector financing facilitation.</p>, <p><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181087369\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181087447\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Ref181180947\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181201274\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181270904\"></a><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Impact of the fiscal channel on GDP and inflation<br/><br/>Our macroeconomic simulations indicate that NGEU-induced fiscal stimulus can generate significant gains for euro area output (Table 3)</strong>. These gains are projected to range between 0.3% and 0.8% by 2026, the final implementation year, with persistent effects of 0.2% to 0.6% by 2031. This lasting impact reflects the durable nature of NGEU investment projects, which primarily target government investment and contribute to long-term productive capacity. Effects are particularly pronounced in the main beneficiary countries, including Italy and Spain, where gains are two to three times higher than for the euro area average.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The assumptions regarding both RRF fund absorption and productivity are important, with absorption being particularly decisive.</strong> In the low-absorption scenario, where implementation maintains the slow pace observed in the past, output gains halve compared with the full absorption scenario, both assuming medium productivity (Table 3, bottom row). Productivity assumptions also significantly influence final outcomes, with low and high productivity scenarios showing notable differences from the central case (Table 3, top rows). Governments aiming to maximise the programme’s impact should prioritise efficient projects offering the highest economic returns.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The output gains from NGEU are still largely to materialise, contingent on implementation catch-up.</strong> The programme has experienced significant backloading compared with the previous assessment, resulting in modest output benefits thus far. However, substantial resources should be deployed in the coming years. Assuming high absorption of the remaining funds, the catch-up in implementation should result in output gains that nearly double those observed to date (Chart 6).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Regarding inflation, the analysis identifies a modest impact on the euro area (Chart 7).</strong> Our simulations suggest a peak difference of around 0.1 percentage points compared with the non-programme baseline. In the main beneficiary countries – Italy and Spain – effects could temporarily reach 0.3 percentage points. Inflation dynamics are largely model-dependent: forward-looking models like EAGLE show rapid demand-driven inflation offset by anticipated productivity increases, while backward-looking models like ECB-MC capture gradual price adjustments to demand pressures.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The current assessment reflects significant time reprofiling compared with a previous evaluation.</strong> The 2021 assessment assumed ambitious and rapid implementation from the outset, with early output gains.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.12\" id=\"fn12\">12</a>]</sup> However, implementation delays have pushed execution into the second half of NGEU’s lifespan, shifting the timing of the programme’s impact. Despite these delays, the magnitude of the overall effect remains broadly in line with initial estimates.</p>, <p><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181087448\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181087370\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181201275\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181270905\"></a><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Impact of structural reforms on potential output<br/></strong><br/><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Updated estimates by an ESCB expert team suggest that NGEU could raise the level of euro area potential output by 1.0% by 2031 and 1.3% by 2033 if the RRPs are fully implemented.</strong> These estimates encompass the impact of both fiscal expenditure and structural reforms. The estimates are not identical to those presented for the fiscal channel in the previous section, since they are based on a different methodology and look at potential as opposed to actual output.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.13\" id=\"fn13\">13</a>]</sup> Potential growth could be boosted by 0.10-0.15 percentage points per annum over 2020-2033 (Chart 8). Until around 2027 a significant part of the impact is expected to arrive via the capital contribution, representing the impact of investments. Afterwards, the largest part of the impact is expected to operate via structural reforms, mostly affecting the contribution of total factor productivity to potential growth, and to some extent the labour contribution. These estimates cover the impacts of both reforms and investment.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.14\" id=\"fn14\">14</a>]</sup> Moreover, the estimates include the RRF as well as the other NGEU instruments.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The updated estimates indicate a smaller impact of NGEU on potential output over the period 2020 to 2030 than estimated in 2022.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.15\" id=\"fn15\">15</a>]</sup> The ex-ante exercise expected a 0.5% impact on the level of euro area potential output by 2024. In the updated exercise, the estimated impact in 2024 is only 0.2% and the long-term impact of 1.3% is expected to materialise in 2033 instead of 2030 (Chart 9, panel a). The delay is also visible in the expected impact on potential growth: in 2022-2023, the growth impact is estimated to have been around half of what was originally foreseen. A lower growth impact is also expected over the long term, that is, 2025-2030 (Chart 9, panel b). The smaller expected impact on potential growth also reflects the fact that the previously anticipated effects of investments hardly materialised in 2022-2023, with 2024 being a transition year. From 2025 onwards, a pick-up in the impact on potential growth is expected as structural reforms start having an effect on potential growth. In the most recent update, however, this impact is also estimated to be slower. Overall, the lower and delayed impact stemming from investments and the lower impact coming from structural reforms leads to a smaller impact on the near-term potential growth profile than in the initial estimates.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The revisions to the potential output estimates mainly reflect a backloading of previously expected effects on account of observed implementation delays.</strong> In fact, the long-term estimates regarding potential output growth converge to a similar level in both estimation vintages.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.16\" id=\"fn16\">16</a>]</sup> The differences between the two vintages mainly lie in the time profile over the short to medium term. This reflects the assumption of the ESCB expert group that the RRPs will eventually be fully implemented, despite the delays observed in the first half of NGEU’s envisaged lifespan. Notwithstanding this, the downside risks surrounding the potential output baseline estimates have increased since 2022 owing to the observed implementation delays.</p>, <p><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181087371\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181087449\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181201276\"></a><a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Toc181270906\"></a><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Impact on public debt and quality of public finance<br/></strong><br/><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The impact of the RRF on government debt-to-GDP ratios is estimated to be favourable and significant for the main beneficiary countries, as well as for the euro area as whole.</strong> <a class=\"link-inline\" id=\"_Hlk180482912\"></a>For the debt impact, the analysis starts from the June 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections under the assumption that all currently expected RRF effects are at play, including a GNI-based repayment as of 2028 (see Section ‎2.1).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.17\" id=\"fn17\">17</a>]</sup> A counterfactual scenario without the RRF is built by subtracting all the RRF’s debt-reducing and debt-increasing effects. For Italy and Spain, the overall debt-reducing impact of the RRF is estimated to be around 7-8 percentage points in the central scenario assuming middle productivity (Chart 10). The overall impact on debt does not change significantly when applying high or low productivity assumptions. Turning to the whole euro area, the impact of the RRF on its debt ratio is also estimated to be favourable<strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.18\" id=\"fn18\">18</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The effects of the RRF on government debt ratios operate via four main channels, as illustrated in Chart 11:</strong></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Although the favourable effects on the debt-to-GDP ratios of the main beneficiaries remain significant, this update points to a significant downward revision compared with initial ECB staff estimates.</strong> For Italy and Spain, the projected impact by 2031 has been revised down to 7-8 percentage points from 12-14, as per Bańkowski et al. (2022). This is mainly due to delays in implementation, which have reduced the impact on both budget outcomes and GDP. More crucially, these delays have led to a significant downward revision in potential GDP, affecting long-term debt projections.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Lastly, the RRF implementation may also be driving some improvement in the quality of public finance at the national level.</strong> Preliminary evidence on the changes in the composition of public expenditure in the main beneficiary countries suggests that the implementation of the RRF has resulted in a shift towards items with stronger effects on GDP growth, such as renewable energy, charging stations for electric vehicles, the digitalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises and artificial intelligence.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.20\" id=\"fn20\">20</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">NGEU is expected to have a positive impact on euro area output in the long run, while the impact on inflation is expected to be relatively muted. </strong>Model-based estimates suggest that public expenditure and structural reforms linked to NGEU have the potential to increase the level of euro area GDP by around 0.4 to0.9% by 2026 and 0.8 to 1.2% by 2031. The estimation ranges reflect the prevailing uncertainty around key assumptions, most notably whether the planned investments and reforms will be implemented completely and effectively. The favourable impacts of NGEU are projected to contribute to a decline in the government debt-to-GDP ratios of the main beneficiary countries. On the nominal side, NGEU is only likely to have a muted impact on euro area inflation owing to countervailing demand and supply effects.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">However, the expected positive impact on output is likely to materialise later than initially expected and subject to downside risks.</strong> Even the upper bound of the updated estimates of NGEU’s impact on the level of euro area output in 2031 is lower than what was envisaged in ECB staff estimates from early 2022. This downward revision largely reflects delays in the implementation of the national investment and reform plans. These delays, in turn, mainly reflect administrative constraints and the ramifications of the energy inflation shock following the Russian war on Ukraine. Despite the inflation surge, the programme’s real value has remained approximately stable through concurrent increases in RRF-related investment financing grants to euro area countries. Also, the projected long-run impact of NGEU on the growth rate of euro area output is largely in line with previous results. Therefore, the revisions to the output estimates overall constitute a <em>reprofiling</em> rather than a reassessment of NGEU’s long-run effectiveness. Given the transmission lags involved, it is arguably too early to draw firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of NGEU-linked investments and reforms. Even so, the risk of ineffective or incomplete implementation of NGEU-linked investments and reforms has increased since 2022. The implementation delays observed so far, combined with the fixed end-date of NGEU, suggest that some projects could either be “rushed through” at the expense of implementation quality, or cancelled altogether.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">By taking targeted policy action, euro area countries can ensure that NGEU-linked investments and reforms are implemented more effectively.</strong> Most notably, Member States could redirect administrative resources, make more intensive use of available technical support at EU level and identify targeted regulatory changes that would facilitate the roll-out of their NGEU projects. Such corrective policy measures might alleviate any emerging trade-off between the speed and quality of plan execution in the second half of the NGEU’s envisaged lifespan, that is, until August 2026. More generally, such policy efforts are vital to ensuring that NGEU can unlock its transformative potential and act as a catalyst for the modernisation and strengthening of the euro area economies.</p>]\n"

Recent reports by Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta have highlighted these challenges and the need for urgent and concrete action that will enable Europe to catch up and maintain a competitive edge over its global competitors.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.2\" id=\"fn2\">2</a>]</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.3\" id=\"fn3\">3</a>]</sup> The priority of the incoming European Commission is to speed up the rate of reform and investment, placing a particular focus on innovation, decarbonisation and strategic autonomy.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.4\" id=\"fn4\">4</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Competitiveness is a complex and multi-faceted concept that can be defined in various ways. </strong>Although there are multiple factors that interact with and influence competitiveness, the only sustainable long-term strategy to maintain a high level of competitiveness is robust productivity growth. This also boils down to ensuring that citizens enjoy a high standard of living. In light of current geopolitical tensions, competitiveness also needs to go hand-in-hand with resilience, i.e. the ability to withstand and adapt to shocks. By reducing those foreign strategic dependencies that create uncertainty and dampen investment, Europe can strengthen both its competitiveness and its economic security.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">This article focuses on the role institutions can play in boosting productivity growth through investment, innovation, and the green and digital transitions, thereby improving the competitiveness of the European economy.</strong> It follows on from previous Economic Bulletin articles that have focused on the external dimension and the potential implications energy shocks and corporate investment might have for European competitiveness.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.5\" id=\"fn5\">5</a>]</sup> Sustainable, long-term growth and economic competitiveness and resilience are underpinned by favourable institutional frameworks and complementary, high-quality physical infrastructures. Achieving sustainable economic growth and maintaining a competitive edge while advancing the green transition depends on key factors such as productivity growth, firm dynamism (generally the rate at which firms enter, grow and exit the market), investment, innovation and digital technology diffusion. The macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, including demographics and trade relations, also influences institutions and infrastructures and frames the broader policy options and priorities.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The remainder of this article expands on the role key institutions play in ensuring competitiveness in the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. </strong>The next section briefly discusses measures of Europe’s productivity gap compared with other leading economies and links it to shortcomings in firm dynamism, investment, innovation and the diffusion of digital technology. Section 3 takes a detailed look at the role institutions play in supporting the broader framework in which European firms operate, grow and innovate, and highlights areas in need of reform. Box 1 provides a targeted examination of the complementary physical infrastructures and networks. Section 4 concludes by joining the call for urgent and concrete structural reform and policies to enhance Europe's competitiveness and resilience.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Several studies show that low productivity growth in Europe is at the heart of the challenges it is facing in terms of competitiveness and that this is largely related to developments in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. </strong>In the last few decades,<strong class=\"intense-emphasis\"> </strong>productivity gains have gradually been slowing in many advanced economies.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.6\" id=\"fn6\">6</a>]</sup> Weaker productivity growth in Europe compared with the United States (US) stems mainly from the lower productivity and lower economic weighting of ICT-intensive industries. Chart 1, panel a, illustrates that after catching up with the United States until 1995, the euro area productivity gap started to widen. These productivity differences reflect both lower capital deepening and total factor productivity (TFP) contributions to growth in GDP per hour worked.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.7\" id=\"fn7\">7</a>]</sup> Insight into whether this can be explained by the ICT revolution having less of an effect in Europe than in the United States can be obtained by studying the differences at sectoral level. Gordon and Sayed analysed the developments in the United States and a set of EU countries using industry-level data.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.8\" id=\"fn8\">8</a>]</sup> For the period 1995-2005, they found that, in contrast to the United States, Europe experienced a slowdown in productivity growth due to several factors, including a scarcity of ICT investment, a failure to capture the efficiency benefits of ICT and performance shortfalls in specific industries including ICT production, finance and insurance, retail and wholesale, and agriculture.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Firm dynamism is weaker in Europe than in the United States.</strong> While firm dynamism has suffered a secular decline in both Europe and the United States, the latter has seen the formation of relatively more new firms and a lower number of bankruptcy declarations in recent years.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.9\" id=\"fn9\">9</a>]</sup> In Europe, the average age of firms at the frontier, i.e. the most technologically advanced and productive firms within a particular industry, has increased substantially in recent decades. In the early 2000s frontier firms in manufacturing were on average 14 years old compared with over 20 years old today.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.10\" id=\"fn10\">10</a>]</sup> Labour productivity growth tends to decline as firms age, which may point towards a lack of competition and a low churn rate at the productivity frontier in Europe. Indeed, there appears to be a connection between the lack of competition from new, innovative firms and the survival of mature firms at the frontier.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.11\" id=\"fn11\">11</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Reducing financial constraints would support the development of innovative, young and small firms.</strong> Compared with their United States counterparts, Europe’s young, high-growth firms have a smaller economic footprint, with too few of them growing quickly and eventually making it to the top.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.12\" id=\"fn12\">12</a>]</sup> These firms often face more severe financial constraints than their established counterparts due to investor risk aversion, a lack of relationships of trust and a reliance on intangible assets, which are more difficult to collateralise.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.13\" id=\"fn13\">13</a>]</sup> Business dynamism has also been found to be lower in regions where the population is older (see also Section 3 below).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.14\" id=\"fn14\">14</a>]</sup> Overall, the result is a European corporate ecosystem of relatively small and ageing firms that are unable to compete globally.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.15\" id=\"fn15\">15</a>]</sup> Part of the solution lies in further integrating and developing capital markets in Europe, including risk capital markets such as venture capital, to complement the banking sector and enhance risk-taking capacity.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.16\" id=\"fn16\">16</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Increasing investment, particularly in intangibles such as research and development (R&amp;D) and in the diffusion of digital technology, could improve Europe’s productivity. </strong>As shown in Chart 1, panel b, the euro area allocates a smaller proportion of its GDP to ICT equipment and intellectual property products than the United States, with the gap widening in recent years.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.17\" id=\"fn17\">17</a>]</sup> In addition, Europe focuses on marginal improvements in already mature technologies rather than in breakthrough innovation, meaning it is stuck in the “middle-technology trap”.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.18\" id=\"fn18\">18</a>]</sup> In terms of digital uptake, recent firm level analysis for the euro area shows that the adoption of digital technologies could lead to an increase in firms’ productivity in the medium term. But the effect of digital adoption is heterogenous across firms and sectors, and not all digital technologies deliver significant productivity gains. One way to increase the productivity benefits of digitalisation could be more efficient and effective institutions and governance structures, and complementary skills.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.19\" id=\"fn19\">19</a>]</sup> At the same time, enhancing European firms’ scaling up could advance their digitalisation.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.20\" id=\"fn20\">20</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Although the EU is lagging behind in R&amp;D expenditure, its green innovation activity is still comparable to that of other major regions. </strong>In the EU, the expenditure on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP has been hovering around 2% in the last decade. This is much lower than in the United States and Japan, for example, and most recently was also below that of China (Chart 2, panel a), with most of the gap stemming from the private sector.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.21\" id=\"fn21\">21</a>]</sup> On the positive side, green innovation activity in the EU (in terms of international patent families) remains comparable for now with that of other countries, such as Japan and the United States. China, however, has been catching up at a fast pace and surpassed other major regions in 2021 (Chart 2, panel b).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.22\" id=\"fn22\">22</a>]</sup> If Europe wants to maintain its strong role in cleantech innovation, it will have to focus on patenting and scaling up, and to tackle regulatory fragmentation to ensure it reaps the full benefits of the Single Market.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Institutions play a pivotal role in fostering a dynamic business environment, investment, innovation, and therefore productivity and competitiveness.</strong> Defined broadly, institutions encompass the formal and informal rules, norms and organisations that provide the structure for social, political and economic interactions. Research by the 2024 Nobel Laureates Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson emphasises the importance of inclusive institutions that provide broad access to economic opportunities and protect individuals against abuses of power.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.23\" id=\"fn23\">23</a>]</sup> In addition to ensuring the rule of law and reducing corruption, institutions that support human capital development, such as educational systems, are crucial for enhancing competitiveness. Well-functioning institutions in these areas also ensure a skilled workforce, which is indispensable for productivity growth and innovation.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.24\" id=\"fn24\">24</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Legal and regulatory frameworks significantly influence the business environment and firms’ investment decisions. </strong>Although most regulations are designed with the aim of protecting people’s health and the environment, they may have unintended economic and social consequences. Complex planning and approval procedures can be serious obstacles to investment, especially for small firms and in the context of the digital and green transitions. Regulations limiting the entry of firms into product and services markets, or constraining the use of certain technologies or data, can hinder the adoption of new technologies by increasing costs for new high-technology firms, therefore reducing competition and constraining technology spillovers.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The complexity and variability of regulations across EU Member States create barriers to entry and increase compliance costs for businesses, making Europe less attractive compared with more streamlined regulatory environments like the United States. </strong>The European Investment Bank (EIB) Investment Survey has identified long-term barriers to firms’ investment decisions (Chart 3). More firms in Europe report major long-term barriers to investment than in the United States. While the availability of skilled staff is identified as the biggest barrier in both the EU and the United States, about twice as many firms in Europe report challenges such as higher energy costs, difficulties in accessing funding, and deficits in transport and digital infrastructure (see also Box 1). In a similar vein, more firms in the EU say that business and labour regulations are a major barrier to investment. While the difference does not seem to be very large, the EU average masks extensive heterogeneity across EU countries (see Chart 4, panel a). A similarly heterogeneous picture emerges regarding corporate restructuring processes, which need to be simplified, shortened and more harmonised. In 2019 the average time to resolve insolvency in the EU was double (around two years) that in the United States (Chart 4, panel b).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The regulatory landscape in the United States is generally considered more business-friendly and focused on minimising bureaucratic hurdles to encourage innovation and investment. </strong>For example, the United States has a more flexible approach to environmental regulations and a less stringent data protection framework compared with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. This can make it easier for companies to operate and invest in new technologies and green initiatives. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 report, the average time to start a business in Europe varies considerably across countries and in many it is significantly longer than in the United States, highlighting the less efficient and fragmented regulatory processes in the EU.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.25\" id=\"fn25\">25</a>]</sup> The International Monetary Fund estimates that overall trade costs within Europe are equivalent to a sizeable ad valorem tariff of 44% for the average manufacturing sector compared with 15% between US states, and as high as 110% for services.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.26\" id=\"fn26\">26</a>]</sup> A large part of these high costs in Europe is related to regulatory entry barriers, which remain particularly high, especially for services.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The recent reports by Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi also point to regulatory burden and fragmentation, which limit the ability of EU companies to scale up and compete internationally.</strong> Completing the Single Market and streamlining and harmonising business regulations where appropriate will be key to changing this. Examples include proposals to create a new business code as a 28<sup>th</sup> regime for European innovative companies (with a harmonised and limited set of regulations that would allow innovative firms to expand quickly across the entire EU), and steps towards harmonising national insolvency frameworks.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.27\" id=\"fn27\">27</a>]</sup> More expedient and harmonised procedures for cleantech applications could be another area to explore. A first step in this direction is the unitary patent system launched in 2023, which makes it possible to acquire patent protection in 17 EU Member States by submitting a single request to the European Patent Office.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">To address long-term barriers to investment related to access to financing, deeper capital markets and financial integration are essential. </strong>This could help create a unified and thus deep and liquid capital market, enabling firms to access a diverse range of funding sources, including venture capital. Increased access to risk capital could enable companies to boost investment in intangibles and R&amp;D, including breakthrough innovations, while supporting financing for the green and digital transitions. A detailed discussion into these issues is beyond the scope of this article but is extensively covered in other ECB publications.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.28\" id=\"fn28\">28</a>]</sup></p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">High-quality public institutions, as reflected in the efficient functioning of public administration, law enforcement and transparency, are prerequisites for the successful design and implementation of sound economic policies</strong>. One way to identify areas where improvements are needed most is to look at the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) data set. It summarises how companies, citizens and experts view the quality of governance. About half of EU countries have seen a deterioration in their composite ranking in the WGI over the last decade, and on average the current quality of EU institutions is below that of institutions in the United States and Japan (Chart 5).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Administrative capacity is also part of governance and a particularly critical factor in facilitating investment during the green and digital transitions.</strong> The European Commission has recognised the importance of robust administrative frameworks in driving these transitions. The European Green Deal and the 2030 Digital Compass highlight the need for strong administrative systems to ensure that funds are allocated efficiently and that projects meet stringent environmental and technological standards.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.29\" id=\"fn29\">29</a>]</sup> The recent experience with the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) also highlighted the obstacles to the timely and effective absorption and use of funds related to administrative capacity bottlenecks, which was in part related to the RRF’s complex reporting and control system.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.30\" id=\"fn30\">30</a>]</sup> Well-developed administrative capacity can streamline the application, permit and screening processes, thus reducing the delays and uncertainties that often hinder investment.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Educational systems play a key role in strengthening human capital and innovation. </strong>To enable technological change and innovation and to take advantage of the associated opportunities they offer, high-quality education systems alongside effective upskilling and reskilling programs are crucial. The latest results from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) underscore the need for Europe to continue improving its educational outcomes (Chart 6). According to the 2022 PISA results, several European countries, such as Estonia, Ireland and Finland, performed well on average in science, mathematics and reading. Compared with 2018, scores in most EU countries deteriorated significantly. This can only be partially attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, as scores were already falling pre-pandemic.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.31\" id=\"fn31\">31</a>]</sup> Significant disparities in educational performance remain in the EU, which continues to lag behind the United States and Japan.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">In addition to education systems, reskilling and upskilling are essential to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of the labour market driven by the digital and green transitions. </strong>The European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience emphasises the importance of lifelong learning and continuous skills development.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.32\" id=\"fn32\">32</a>]</sup> The Agenda aims to equip the workforce, including managers, with the skills needed to thrive in emerging industries and to support the EU’s goals in the digital and green transitions.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.33\" id=\"fn33\">33</a>]</sup> Europe needs to intensify its focus on education and skills development to catch up with the United States in technological innovation and diffusion. As mentioned at the beginning of Section 3, having skilled employees is also a major long-term barrier to business investment in Europe. The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) highlights the importance of skills intelligence and workforce planning. More integrated and forward-looking strategies in Europe to address skills shortages and mismatches are needed to achieve a more technologically advanced, greener and fairer future.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.34\" id=\"fn34\">34</a>]</sup> The importance of skills to address challenges on the competitiveness front is also highlighted in the Letta report, including the simplification of degrees and improved certification recognition across Europe.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Negative demographic developments represent a challenge for Europe’s labour supply both in terms of quantity and skills. </strong>However, the relationship with productivity growth is less certain. In the years to come, older cohorts will make up an increasing part of the labour force. Their retirement will result in a reduced labour supply and shortages of certain skills, while there is no conclusive evidence of productivity gains from the younger cohorts being more formally educated.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.35\" id=\"fn35\">35</a>]</sup> Acemoglu and Restrepo<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.36\" id=\"fn36\">36</a>]</sup> show that higher capital investments, such as greater adoption of robots and other automation technologies, could mitigate and even reverse the negative relationship between age and productivity. At the same time, older workers may be ill-equipped for a work environment which is rapidly adopting new technologies.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Migrants are an important part of the European labour force and can help boost the labour supply and productivity, particularly against the backdrop of ageing populations.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.37\" id=\"fn37\">37</a>]</sup> Research shows that migration can have positive effects on productivity and long-term economic growth.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.38\" id=\"fn38\">38</a>]</sup> In recent years, amid high labour market tightness in Europe, migration has helped alleviate labour shortages and moderate wage growth, particularly in the hospitality, support services and construction sectors where entry barriers based on qualifications or language are lower.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.39\" id=\"fn39\">39</a>]</sup> Nonetheless, addressing the high degree of overqualification and skills mismatches experienced by migrants compared with permanent residents and nationals, could further help address labour and skills shortages and raise labour productivity gains.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.40\" id=\"fn40\">40</a>]</sup> The lower educational attainment levels of second-generation students in some countries also highlight problems related to the success of immigration or integration policies.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Europe faces critical challenges in boosting productivity, investment and innovation, and therefore its competitiveness and resilience. </strong>Long-standing challenges related to low productivity growth, burdensome regulations and demographic headwinds have been compounded by geopolitical tensions, trade fragmentation and the prospects of persistently higher energy prices. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive structural reforms targeting higher regulatory efficiency, enhanced governance and administrative capacity, improved quality of education and skills’ matching, and modernised infrastructure. The population is shrinking, and our societies are ageing, so sustaining the workforce will rely on higher participation rates, especially among women and older people, alongside well-designed immigration policies to address labour shortages and support long-term growth.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Mario Draghi’s proposals for enhancing European competitiveness and Enrico Letta’s proposals for empowering the Single Market highlight the need for coordinated action at the national level supported by more EU where it adds the most value.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.48\" id=\"fn48\">48</a>]</sup> National policies must prioritise increasing productivity growth through measures that support business dynamism, the adoption of technology, the financing of private investment and breakthrough innovations, and that address labour shortages and skill mismatches. At the EU level, the re-focusing of policy required could be facilitated by coordination based on agreed EU priorities. In addition, EU-level action is needed to provide essential public goods, including affordable and greener energy, breakthrough research and digital infrastructure for a wider diffusion of advanced technologies, especially artificial intelligence. “More Europe where it matters” also requires deepening the Single Market and strengthening cross-border, market-based risk sharing.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">This article joins the call for urgent and concrete structural reforms in Europe.</strong> The interplay between institutions, infrastructures and competitiveness underscores the need for transformative policy action. Addressing structural barriers, including inadequate physical and digital infrastructures and skill mismatches, while increasing access to finance, would enhance the potential for growth. Structural reforms would then also facilitate the smooth transmission of monetary policy to the whole euro area economy and thereby help preserve price stability in the euro area.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.49\" id=\"fn49\">49</a>]</sup> At the same time, such reforms and policies need to be shaped with a view to supporting the green and digital transitions and ensuring economic and social resilience to geopolitical tensions and possible future shocks. Crucially, improving the social acceptability of reforms and ensuring balanced regulation are key to their success.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.50\" id=\"fn50\">50</a>]</sup> Overall, policies need to be carefully designed, striking a balance between regulation and flexibility. This should ensure the protection of public interest without compromising on innovation and investment and therefore contribute towards sustainable improvements in European productivity and overall living standards.</p>]\n"

      "[<p class=\"ecb-authors\">Prepared by Clémence Berson, Vasco Botelho, António Dias da Silva, Claudia Foroni, Matthias Mohr, Christofer Schroeder and Marco Weissler</p>, <p>Published as part of the <a class=\"link-inline arrow\" href=\"/press/economic-bulletin/html/eb202408.en.html\">ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 8/2024</a>.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">In the aftermath of the pandemic, the euro area labour market has shown remarkable resilience.</strong> The unemployment rate has remained at record lows and employment has grown steadily despite weak economic growth and various challenges to the economy, such as the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, geopolitical tensions and the subsequent monetary policy tightening. From the fourth quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2024, cumulative employment growth (3.3%) outpaced cumulative real GDP growth (2.4%) by 0.9 percentage points. This is remarkable given that both employment and output had fully recovered to their respective pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021. The resilience of employment has, however, led to a decline in labour productivity growth, measured in terms of average output per employee, which has dipped below its already weak historical trend. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Higher profit margins and lower real wages, together with lower average hours worked per employee, have allowed firms to hire more workers and retain staff during weak economic growth, while increased labour force participation has helped address potential labour shortages.</strong> The surge in inflation at the onset of the energy crisis significantly reduced real wages, making hiring less costly for firms. This created incentives for them to favour labour input, given rising prices for energy and intermediate inputs, thereby contributing to resilient labour market dynamics during a period of weak economic growth.<strong class=\"intense-emphasis\"> </strong>Additionally, substantially higher profit margins allowed firms to hire additional workers or maintain their current labour force. Faced with actual, or expected, labour shortages, firms chose to retain their workers, seeing labour hoarding as a less costly option than seeking replacement workers upon recovery from what was regarded as a temporary weak economic environment. Lower average hours worked per employee, amid still robust labour demand, encouraged companies to hire more workers to maintain their overall labour input. Recent survey evidence suggests that labour hoarding was one of the factors behind the decline in average hours worked per employee, with firms reducing working time in response to what they perceived as temporary lower demand.<strong class=\"intense-emphasis\"> </strong>Moreover, sustained labour force growth in the post-pandemic period has incentivised firms to get new workers on board to address actual or expected labour shortages. The labour force participation rate has risen above pre-pandemic levels, driven primarily by transitions from inactivity to employment. Women, older workers, persons with a higher education and foreign workers have contributed the most to this increase. Faced with the possibility of labour shortages, firms hired these additionally available workers by way of precaution, despite subdued economic activity.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">This article closely examines each of these four factors, focusing on labour market dynamics in the euro area as a whole.</strong> The favourable aggregate dynamics reveal increasing heterogeneity across sectors, with low productivity sectors driving the aggregated data. While recognising the significant differences at the country level, analysing the euro area labour market at the aggregated level is key to a comprehensive understanding of the real economy and of the choices made by firms and workers that determine price and wage inflation. It also provides the ECB with important insight, which it needs to make effective policy decisions in line with its price stability mandate. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The post-pandemic period was characterised by a remarkably robust labour market in the euro area.</strong> The recovery in economic activity following the pandemic was swift and accompanied by strong growth in employment. This stands in contrast to the periods following the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis, which saw slower employment growth despite a rebound in economic activity. By the end of 2021, the number of workers in job retention schemes – a feature of labour markets during the pandemic – came down significantly, pointing to the absence of hysteresis effects in the labour market and of any significant need for major job reallocation in the euro area.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.1\" id=\"fn1\">1</a>]</sup> Even the slowdown in economic activity following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting spike in energy prices, had no visible negative impact on the labour market.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The euro area labour market’s performance has been exceptional as compared with changes in output (Chart 1, panel a).</strong> The relationship between employment and output growth, known as Okun’s law, suggests that employment and GDP developments were broadly aligned in 2022, while a gap emerged in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, the difference between actual employment and that suggested by GDP growth, rose to nearly 600 thousand workers, or around 0.35% of persons employed. The strong growth in employment in comparison with GDP was supported by firms retaining their workers, facilitated by rising corporate profits, declining real wages and lower average hours worked per person employed, as well as by robust growth in the labour force (Chart 1, panel b).<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.2\" id=\"fn2\">2</a>]</sup> The fall in the average hours worked reflects the fact that the total hours worked has risen only modestly since late 2019 compared with the increase in the number of persons employed – a development which is discussed in detail in Section 5 of this article.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Strong employment growth and weak GDP dynamics have led to a decline in productivity growth.</strong> The slowdown in productivity growth predates the pandemic but has gathered pace since 2022, under the combined effect of various adverse shocks to the euro area.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.3\" id=\"fn3\">3</a>]</sup><sup> </sup>Quarter-on-quarter productivity growth turned negative in the fourth quarter of 2022 and has remained well below its pre-pandemic trend since then. On a cumulative basis, it has declined by 1.3% since the fourth quarter of 2021. Recently, however, there have been signs that the fall in labour productivity is slowing, given that quarter-on-quarter growth has been zero or slightly positive since the first quarter of 2024.  </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The trends for aggregate employment and productivity mask heterogeneity across sectors.</strong> While employment growth was most prominent in the construction, public, and professional services sectors, it was weak in the manufacturing sector. Gross value added also developed differently across sectors, as did productivity. Strong growth in employment in the public and construction sectors between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2024 (8.9% and 7.1% respectively) outpaced that of gross value added (2.3% and 3.0% respectively), leading to a pronounced slowdown in productivity growth in these two sectors. By contrast, information and communication services saw a substantial increase in productivity growth, driven by robust growth in gross value added. For some sectors, changes in productivity growth evolved into two distinct phases: the acute pandemic period, from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2021, and the post-pandemic period after the first quarter of 2022. In the manufacturing sector, for example, cumulative growth in productivity per person and per hour stood at 8.6% and 7.8% respectively during the acute pandemic period. With the spike in energy prices in 2022, however, productivity growth turned negative and cumulative growth in productivity per person and per hour in the post-pandemic period fell to -2.4% and -2.9% respectively. Contact-intensive service sectors, such as the hospitality and food services industries, also saw growth in productivity of 1.6% per person and per hour during the acute pandemic period. While cumulative growth in productivity per person in these sectors remained positive during the post-pandemic period, rising to 1.6%, productivity growth per hour declined by 0.1%.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The unemployment rate has remained at record lows.</strong> In September 2024 the unemployment rate in the euro area stood at 6.3% – the lowest ever to be recorded since the introduction of the euro and 1.1 percentage points below the pre-pandemic level observed in January 2020. The decline in the unemployment rate was broad-based across countries, with some variations. Spain and Italy, for example, experienced the largest reductions in unemployment rates over this period (-2.6 percentage points and -3.5 percentage points respectively), whereas Germany saw a slight rise (+0.3 percentage points). The fall at the euro area level was driven by a slight drop in the number of unemployed, of around 1.3 million persons, coupled with a significant increase in the labour force of 8.6 million compared with January 2020. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Labour demand has remained robust over</strong><strong class=\"strong-emphasis\"> </strong><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">the post-pandemic period, albeit it has started to ease more recently.</strong> The job vacancy rate spiked at 3.3% in the second quarter of 2022, pointing to a tight labour market, despite a deterioration in matching efficiency as regards job vacancies and job seekers. Since then, this rate has gradually declined, having fallen to 2.5% in the third quarter of 2024 – only 0.2 percentage points higher than its pre-pandemic level. Waning labour demand in recent quarters, coupled with a stable unemployment rate, has resulted in a vertical Beveridge curve and improved efficiency matching (Chart 2).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Since the end of the pandemic, growth in employment has significantly exceeded that of economic activity.</strong> Historically, based on Okun’s law, employment growth typically expands at approximately half the rate of real GDP growth, with Okun’s elasticities estimated to range between 0.2 and 0.5. Employment growth has, however, surpassed GDP growth since 2022, with elasticities double the conventional estimates (Chart 3, panel a). This phenomenon mirrors the sluggish productivity trends observed within the euro area.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The initial decrease in real wages at the onset of the energy crisis contributed to the disconnect between employment and output growth.</strong> The surge in inflation during the recent energy crisis led to a fall in real wages as nominal wages adjusted with a time lag. Initially, moreover, the decline in real wages outpaced the decline in productivity.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.6\" id=\"fn6\">6</a>]</sup> This gap between real wages and productivity has supported job creation by incentivising firms to hire, or retain, more workers given that labour input was perceived as being less expensive than other inputs (Chart 3, panel b).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">A key factor behind the decoupling of output and employment, leading to negative productivity growth, is the substitution of production factors.</strong> An analysis based on a structural Bayesian vector autoregressive model sheds light on the key factors underlying the decoupling of output and employment fluctuations, as well as the procyclicality of labour productivity. The model incorporates a factor substitution shock, capturing the direct substitution of labour with other production inputs, such as intermediate goods, energy and capital.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.7\" id=\"fn7\">7</a>]</sup> For periods in which there are energy crises and supply chain disruptions, this shock aims to capture the reallocation among inputs following a relative price shock, favouring the cheaper option. When real wages fall compared with other input prices, labour becomes more affordable than energy, capital and intermediate goods, naturally resulting in reallocation and substitution effects. The significance of the factor substitution shock is illustrated by the red bars in Chart 4, showing its substantial impact on productivity growth by driving output down and employment up. Consequently, the model attributes much of the recent productivity decline to cyclical factors. The resilience of the labour market, bolstered by the factor substitution shock, exacerbated this productivity drop. With the dissipation of the factors driving the factor substitution shock, such as the normalisation of energy and intermediate input prices, there has been a modest recovery in productivity.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Additional drivers sustained employment dynamics amid economic stagnation.</strong> Recovering demand supported employment and output growth until early 2023. Since then, weakening demand has led to a sharper slowdown in economic activity compared with employment growth, exacerbating the deviations from Okun’s law (Chart 4, blue bars). A neutral technology shock (Chart 4, yellow bars), indicative of a decline in total factor productivity, exerted a largely negative impact on both output and employment growth, primarily on account of global supply bottlenecks, leaving productivity virtually unaffected. For 2022 the model attributes minimal negative effects to labour market-specific drivers (Chart 4, green bars), such as changes in labour force participation and increased worker bargaining power. These effects were partially reversed in 2023. The catch-up of real wages makes factor substitution less relevant and favours a realignment of employment and output dynamics, as well as a recovery in productivity. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Rising profit margins enabled firms to retain their workers for longer than usual, despite falling revenues.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.8\" id=\"fn8\">8</a>]</sup> Recent ECB estimates show that higher profit margins have improved the ability of firms to hoard labour in the event of an adverse shock to their economic outlook.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.9\" id=\"fn9\">9</a>]</sup> The decision by firms to hoard labour is rational and consistent with long-term profit maximisation goals. Profit maximising firms choose to favour labour hoarding when the costs of redundancies, re-employment or training exceed the costs of worker retention. Increased labour hoarding occurs only when firms expect a temporary decline in demand for their goods or services. If a permanent fall in demand is anticipated, there is no incentive for firms to retain workers, given that their labour input would not be needed.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The ECB labour hoarding indicator has remained above the historical average since the first quarter of 2022 but started to weaken in 2024, primarily on account of lower economic activity.</strong><sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.10\" id=\"fn10\">10</a>]</sup><sup> </sup>The proportion of euro area firms to hoard workers had been relatively flat, at around 12.2%, until the onset of the pandemic, when it sharply increased from 14.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 26.7% in the first quarter of 2020. The indicator has remained elevated since then, albeit showing some cyclical variations including a second sharp increase when energy prices surged. The labour hoarding indicator weakened during the first half of 2024, decreasing from 22% in the third quarter of 2023 to 16% in the second quarter of 2024 (Chart 5, panel a). The indicator for the third quarter of 2024 points to a slight cyclical pick-up in labour hoarding, but to levels significantly lower than those at its peak of 27.4% in the third quarter of 2022. The main driver behind the broad weakening of the labour hoarding indicator is the lower activity margin (Chart 5, panel b). Given that this margin depicts the extent to which adverse shocks affect firms’ outlooks, this suggests that euro area firms are gradually recovering from the energy price shock. In addition, the employment margin, which reflects the ability of firms to retain their workers while contending with these shocks, has been gradually decreasing, suggesting that the buffers that allowed firms to retain their workforce are dissipating. The employment margin of labour hoarding returned to its pre-pandemic level of 73% in the second quarter of 2024, but fell to 70% in the third quarter, 8 percentage points below its peak of 78% in 2022-23. This suggests that firms that are still being affected by negative shocks now have less scope for retaining their workers than in the past, which could be of relevance given that negotiated wages, and consequently labour costs, have been increasing in 2024.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.11\" id=\"fn11\">11</a>]</sup> </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Despite the cyclical increase, the ECB labour hoarding indicator still points to a gradual diminishing of the ability or willingness of firms to retain their workforce, which is broad-based across sectors and particularly strong in market services (Chart 6).</strong> The cyclical increase in the labour hoarding indicator in the third quarter of 2024 was common to the industry, construction and market services sectors. This is indicative of an aggregate systemic weakness in the economy that is not being led by any individual sector. While the labour hoarding indicator increased slightly in the third quarter of 2024, the overall trend points to a gradual return to its pre-pandemic levels in all broad sectors of economic activity. In the third quarter of 2024, the labour hoarding indicator also decreased year on year in all sectors, falling by 5.6 percentage points in industry, by 2.7 percentage points in construction and by 2.0 percentage points in the market services sector as compared with the same quarter in 2023. The decline in labour hoarding observed in the market services sector in the third quarter of 2024 was driven both by a lower activity margin (down by 1.2 percentage points as compared with the third quarter of 2023) and by a narrower employment margin (down by 4.3 percentage points). By contrast, the fall in the activity margin in the industry and construction sectors in the third quarter of 2024 (of around 3.5 percentage points for industry and 1.7 percentage points for construction as compared with the same quarter in 2023) was offset by an increase in the employment margin in both sectors, leading to a smaller decrease in the ECB labour hoarding indicator in these sectors than that which the activity margin would otherwise suggest.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">It is important to continue to monitor the resilience of firms to adverse shocks and their ability to hoard labour when needed.</strong> Euro area firms proved to be highly resilient to the very adverse economic conditions arising from the pandemic-induced lockdowns and the surge in energy prices. The ensuing high profit margins and strong labour hoarding have supported employment growth since the surge in inflation. The expected normalisation of these factors could lead to a gradual deceleration in employment growth over the next few years and may give increasing importance to other channels of adjustment within the euro area labour market, such as changes in labour supply owing to increased workforce participation or cyclical fluctuations in unemployment rates and in labour market transitions from employment into inactivity in the event of a weakness in labour demand.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Average hours worked per employee remained at a relatively lower level following the pandemic, yet helped the labour market to remain resilient in terms of the extensive margin.</strong> In the second quarter of 2024, average hours worked were still 1.2% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019 (Chart 7, panel a), meaning that the average person employed in the euro area worked five hours less per quarter in 2024 compared with before the pandemic. The decline in average hours worked was primarily driven by the public sector and manufacturing (-2.0% and -1.3% respectively), but no sector, other than real estate, has recovered to its pre-pandemic level owing to changes in both labour demand and supply.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Employment growth has remained resilient, despite a slowdown in demand in some sectors and lower average hours worked.</strong> Recent evidence provided by the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises and the ECB Corporate Telephone Survey shows that the lower hours worked were, to some extent, also driven by a reduced need for workers. Firms, in particular in the manufacturing sector, reported weaker demand as a key factor for reduced working time. Alongside current demand levels, firms confirmed that labour hoarding was an important factor behind the declining number of hours worked per employee. For firms, the decrease in average hours worked attributable to lower demand therefore had a structural component, owing to difficulties in hiring new workers, but also had a cyclical component that could be expected to disappear as demand rises.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">On the labour supply side, lower average hours worked are mainly driven by less overtime and a higher prevalence of persons who did not work in the reference week.</strong> Overall, average hours worked in 2022, as measured in the European Union Labour Force Survey, were 0.71 hours per week below their 2019 level.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.12\" id=\"fn12\">12</a>]</sup> Around one-third of this difference (0.26 hours) was due to a higher proportion of people working zero hours during the reference week compared with before the pandemic (Chart 7, panel b). While this was initially attributable primarily to sick leave during and after the pandemic, more recently, new contract types introduced in France and Spain have increased the frequency of zero hours worked.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.13\" id=\"fn13\">13</a>]</sup> Another third of the difference (0.23 hours) was driven by a fall in the number of long hours worked (defined as more than 49 hours per week). Although those working long hours are only a very small percentage of the total workforce, they saw a stark reduction in their working time, reflecting a long-term trend. As regards the last third, average hours worked for the remaining population are 0.22 hours below their pre-pandemic level. This means that a significant proportion of the lower average hours worked is due to a rise in the proportion of zero hours worked and a fall in the proportion of long hours worked.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">There would seem to have been little change in employees working time preferences following the pandemic, suggesting that there will be no future increase in the number of hours supplied and that these preferences will continue to act as a drag on average hours worked.</strong> In line with the fall in average hours worked, the European Union Labour Force Survey shows that the preference for working fewer hours is on a declining trend which was not affected by the pandemic. In 2023, while full-time workers and persons employed in managerial positions had no desire to work more hours, part-time workers and workers in elementary occupations were looking to work more intensively. Given that the lower hours worked are explained by lower labour demand in certain sectors only, a closure of the gap in hours worked compared with the pre-pandemic level would require an increase in supplied hours worked. However, working time preferences overall suggest only limited support for a rise in average hours worked in the future and therefore limited downward risks for employment growth.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The euro area labour force has increased strongly over recent years and remains substantially higher than its pre-pandemic trend, helping firms to address labour shortages.</strong> While the pandemic temporarily discouraged participation in the labour market, the labour force participation rate has since recovered and even surpassed its pre-pandemic levels (Chart 8, panel a). That rate decreased by 2.5 percentage points between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. This reflected a fall in the euro area active working age population of 3.8%, with more than 6 million workers temporarily leaving the labour force during the pandemic according to the data from the European Union Labour Force Survey. Thereafter, the labour force quickly recovered. The labour force participation rate returned to its pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of 2021 and by July 2024 the labour force was some 8.6 million above the figure in January 2020, standing 5.3% higher than during the pre-pandemic period. This rate equates to an upwards trajectory of 0.2% per year since 2022, compared with 0.1% between 2009 and 2020.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.14\" id=\"fn14\">14</a>]</sup> The increased availability of workers may have supported the behaviour of firms in terms of hiring the workers they lacked, or expected to lack, during a period of labour shortages, despite the weak economic environment.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Transitions from inactivity to employment were the main driver of employment growth.</strong> The widespread support from job retention schemes helped to contain the flow from employment to inactivity during the pandemic, thereby preventing a larger and more permanent decline in the labour force. While the increase in labour market discouragement following the pandemic was temporary, the recovery followed different paths across different countries. Chart 8, panel a) shows that France, Spain and the Netherlands recovered to their pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of 2021, while Germany and Italy took longer (second quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023 respectively). The pandemic also had a strong impact on teleworking possibilities, increasing the participation of the most impacted groups (women, older workers and workers with a tertiary education).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, the higher labour force participation rate is currently accounted for primarily by women, older workers, workers with a tertiary education and foreign workers (Chart 8, panel b).</strong> Across gender groups, men accounted for a 0.5 percentage point increase in the labour force participation rate as compared with its pre-pandemic level, while a 0.7 percentage point rise was attributable to women. As regards age groups, both young and older workers contributed to the higher labour force participation rate, accounting for 0.4 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points respectively, with prime-aged workers having a downward impact on the labour force participation rate, standing at -0.9 percentage points. With regard to educational level (or skills) groups, those with a tertiary education were responsible for most of the increase in the labour force participation rate, seeing a 2.9 percentage point rise. Conversely, those with a lower level of education contributed negatively to the labour force participation rate, with a fall of 0.6 percentage points, as did workers with a secondary education (medium-skilled workers), down by 1.1 percentage points. In terms of nationality, the contribution of native workers to the rise in the labour force participation rate was insignificant, whereas foreign workers contributed by 1.2 percentage points. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Two factors underlie the increase in the labour force participation rate across sociodemographic groups: (i) the increase in each group’s participation rates and (ii) changes in each group’s share in the working age population since the onset of the pandemic.</strong> Changes in the composition of the working age population are important for quantifying the contributions of each group to the increase in the labour force participation rate. For example, the ageing of the population can be seen from the sharp reduction in prime-aged workers in the working age population and the strong rise in older workers.<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.15\" id=\"fn15\">15</a>]</sup> While the labour force participation rate for prime-aged workers strengthened between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2024, the sharp decline of this group in the working age population contributed negatively to the overall increase in the labour force participation rate. The same was true for persons with a secondary education. As regards nationality, there was a rise in the working age population for foreign workers in the euro area and a corresponding reduction in the working age population for native workers. Given that both groups saw labour force participation rate increases, their contributions were still positive, albeit around zero for native workers.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Recent survey results suggest that firms expect employment growth to slow over the near term (Chart 9, panel a).</strong> The quarterly Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises asks euro area firms about their employment expectations over the coming 12 months. The results of the most recent survey for the third quarter of 2024 suggest that firms were expecting a continued slowdown in their employment growth. Average employment growth expectations in the euro area as indicated by the survey stood at 1% year on year in the third quarter of 2024, down from 1.3% in the second quarter. This is broadly in line with the near-term slowdown in employment growth foreseen in the <a class=\"link-inline arrow\" href=\"/press/projections/html/ecb.projections202412_eurosystemstaff~71a06224a5.en.html\">December 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area</a>. The European Commission’s survey-based Employment Expectations Indicator, which captures firms’ employment growth expectations for the next three months, also points to muted employment growth expectations. Across sectors, employment growth expectations remain the highest for services and the lowest for the industrial sector. In addition, employment growth expectations have become more aligned with the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (Chart 9, panel a), suggesting that productivity growth will improve. While the two indicators co-moved until the end of 2021, from 2022 onwards employment growth expectations remained consistently higher than economic sentiment, reflecting the lower productivity growth observed during that period.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">The unemployment rate is expected to remain low over the coming quarters.</strong> Following a spike at the outbreak of the pandemic, the unemployment rate expectations of professional forecasters and consumers have fallen steadily. The ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters indicates that the unemployment rate in the euro area is expected to remain stable over the near and long term, and close to its lowest level since the introduction of the euro (Chart 9, panel b). In the latest wave of the survey from the fourth quarter of 2024, the average 12-month ahead forecast stood at 6.5% and the distribution of estimates was roughly balanced around the average. Expectations of the unemployment rate five years ahead were slightly lower, averaging 6.4%. These expectations for the near-term unemployment rate are closely aligned with the average unemployment rate for 2025 of 6.5% foreseen in the <a class=\"link-inline arrow\" href=\"/press/projections/html/ecb.projections202412_eurosystemstaff~71a06224a5.en.html\">December 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area</a>. They are also broadly in line with the expectations of households elicited from the ECB Consumer Expectations Survey. In the most recent wave of this survey, respondents reported lower unemployment rate expectations than in the previous survey,<sup>[<a href=\"#footnote.16\" id=\"fn16\">16</a>]</sup> albeit slightly above those of professional forecasters (Chart 9, panel b).</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Overall, survey data suggest a relatively stable labour market looking ahead.</strong> Employment growth is expected to moderate, whereas unemployment is expected to remain low. Employment expectations also seem to be aligning more closely with expectations for economic activity, which suggests a recovery in productivity growth going forward. Survey-based expectations would therefore appear to support a cyclical adjustment in the labour market.</p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Labour market resilience is an important determinant in assessing future wage and inflation developments.</strong> By closely monitoring labour market resilience, policymakers can better predict and manage inflation, ensuring sustainable economic growth and stability. The factors determining labour market resilience affect the response of inflation to economic shocks differently. The current resilience in employment has been driven primarily by the labour hoarding tendencies of firms and by the immediate adjustment of real wages in response to the energy crisis. Much of the recent strength observed in the euro area labour market can therefore be attributed largely to cyclical factors, which are generally expected to dissipate going forward. </p>, <p><strong class=\"intense-emphasis\">Looking ahead, the euro area labour market is expected to return closer to its historical correlation with output, given that it is anticipated that some of the cyclical factors that sustained employment will abate.</strong> Energy and intermediate input prices are normalising, albeit at a higher level, while inflation is falling and real wages are rebounding. This will make the substitution between labour and other inputs less relevant. As profits stabilise and demand weakens, the incentive for firms to hoard labour will diminish. Structural factors, such as a negative trend in average hours worked and labour force dynamics, are likely to persist over the medium term. Other structural elements are poised to significantly influence future developments in labour markets. Key among these are the ongoing reallocation of resources and the efforts being made to support a green and digital transition. Furthermore, sociodemographic changes will play a critical role in shaping labour market dynamics.</p>]\n"

       "{'2025': ['Prepared by Christian Höynck, Moreno Roma and Kathinka SchliekerPublished as part of theECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 2/2025.Developments in house prices play an important role in the economic and monetary analyses conducted by central banks.Notably, they are indicative of the strength of monetary policy transmission and of household balance sheet positions. Residential property prices, in conjunction with financing conditions, affect the affordability of housing and this can have knock-on effects for, among other things, construction activity and the rental market. This article reviews developments in the recent house price cycle in the euro area to better understand the possible implications for the economy.House price cycles typically follow a boom-bust pattern but can display marked differences in their underlying triggers and drivers.Assessing house price cycles in relation to business cycles only offers a partial perspective. While there is a fair degree of coherence between residential property price and real GDP cycles (Chart 1), the former tends to be longer and have a larger amplitude. Higher volatility associated with boom-bust patterns suggests a larger role for expectations (including speculation) in house price cycles in addition to fundamentals such as income and demand that govern both residential property price and real GDP cycles.[1]Moreover, the degree of synchronicity across countries is lower for house price cycles than real GDP cycles, suggesting that a euro area house price cycle can reflect many country-specific influences.[2]Therefore, this article focuses on stylised facts and broad drivers of house price cycles that are visible at the euro area-wide level.The recent downturn in euro area house prices was relatively mild and short-lived.Data for the third quarter of 2024 suggest that the house price cycle has safely moved past its trough and the level of house prices has already recovered to that of the previous peak observed in the third quarter of 2022. This recovery has been much faster than those following the global financial crisis (GFC) and the sovereign debt crisis (SDC) (Chart 2, panel a). In retrospect, the peak-to-trough part of the cycle saw a cumulative decline of 3% over one and a half years, which was shallower and shorter than the almost 5% cumulative decline recorded over two years during the GFC and the SDC.[3]The relatively limited “bust” in house prices stands out compared with previous cycles, as the run-up to the peak in 2022 had been accompanied by estimated residential property price valuations relative to fundamentals that exceeded those observed at the peaks during the GFC and the SDC (Chart 2, panel b).[4]Disaggregation of euro area house price growth into different characteristics can provide additional insight into the features of the recent house price cycle.While euro area-wide house price dynamics during the GFC and the SDC were largely explained by what, at the time, was called “periphery” countries, recent dynamics were much more strongly driven by “core” countries (Chart 3), and in particular by Germany with its high weight in aggregate house prices. With only 12 of the euro area countries experiencing a decline in prices, the latest cycle was less pervasive than that during the GFC where all but one country experienced a downturn. The change in country composition of euro area-wide dynamics could point to a rotation of boom-busts in combination with an overall broad trend of rising house prices. For some countries, the shift to a more favourable interest rate environment after the introduction of the euro led to a boom-bust cycle that took quite some time to clean up and recover from (as in the case of Spain). During the low interest rate period following the GFC and the SDC, it was mainly other, previously less affected countries that saw their housing markets react to favourable financing conditions, with them eventually seeing a correction of exuberant price dynamics (as in the case of Germany).The recent house price cycle saw more balanced developments between house prices in capital cities and the average house price in their respective countries.Up until the pandemic, house prices in capital cities had a history of growing more strongly than in their respective countries as a whole. At the same time, there was more acceleration and deceleration in the house price dynamics of capital cities (Chart 4). These differences are consistent with the notion that “location” is a key element in house prices and that dynamics are more buoyant in supply constrained markets. A larger share of affluent buyers and a perception of reliable resale values in good locations such as capitals can amplify price movements driven by fundamentals, expectations or speculation as compared with other locations. At the end of 2019, house prices in capital cities were 71% higher than during the pre-GFC period in early 2006, as compared with 28% for the euro area aggregate. The most recent house price cycle has somewhat realigned these relative dynamics, with house prices in euro area capital cities witnessing slower price dynamics than the euro area country average. This could reflect the already high and possibly less affordable price levels in capital cities but, more likely, also the specific and reinforcing impact of the pandemic and its implications for remote working that allowed workers to live further away from their offices and in less expensive locations.[5]House price dynamics in the recent cycle reflected particularly buoyant developments in the prices of existing dwellings.These dwellings account for the bulk of housing transactions and their prices therefore typically define the shape of the overall house price cycle. At the peak of the cycle, the annual growth rate of prices for existing dwellings was half a percentage point higher than that of new dwellings and at the trough it was around 6 percentage points lower, a larger difference than that which had been observed in the GFC and – in particular – the SDC cycles (Chart 5). This likely reflects the long duration of the housing market upturn that may, towards its end, have increasingly been facing supply constraints for new dwellings, making buyers increasingly turn to existing properties. This was then reinforced during the pandemic when construction activity slumped and, at the same time, buyers were looking for dwellings that implied an upgrade in terms of square meters which could be situated in locations with hitherto lower price levels.[6]Once the exuberance element in buying existing dwellings had faded and energy costs became a more relevant element in the type of preferred housing, prices for existing dwellings dwindled much faster than those for new dwellings. The latter’s unwinding was also more constrained, as there were limits to lowering prices in view of the high construction costs under which new dwellings had been built in recent years.The stylised facts indicate that the recent house price cycle was different from those during the GFC and the SDC.The price boom appears to have been broader based across categories and may reflect the fact that increases had also extended to less central locations or to less modern dwellings, particularly in relation to pandemic-related shifts in preferences. This implies that the boom may have come with less financial stretching and exposure of buyers than at other times and that this helped to contain the subsequent bust (Section 3). Ultimately, the price correction unwound the additional surge in prices in the aftermath of the pandemic but left the sustained increases recorded in pre-pandemic years in these price levels. The busts during the GFC and SDC cycles had implied relatively more erosion of previous multi-year price gains.Model-based analysis suggests that, generally speaking, the largest driver in boom-bust house price cycles is the demand factor.The model used in Box 1 identifies housing-specific demand shocks as the main drivers of the house price downturns during the GFC and SDC cycles, but not during the latest downturn. Instead, aggregate supply shocks related to energy price shocks and pandemic-related supply disruptions had a relatively larger impact. Contrary to past cycles, the model also sees monetary policy more noticeably contributing to the recent downturn than the past declines in house prices. This is consistent with the profound change from a long period of low mortgage interest rates to a period of steep tightening of financing conditions and possible non-linear effects emanating from such a change.[7]Decompositions of house price developments into originating shocks can be a starting point for an assessment of driving factors but they are naturally model-specific, depending on the selection of variables and shocks and how these shocks are identified. Assessing house price cycles therefore also benefits from a model-free discussion of pertinent groups of factors and indicators.[8]Demand factors go some way towards explaining the recent house price cycle.Looking beyond the short-lived constraints in activity during the lockdown of the pandemic period, growth in housing investment and transactions point to a period of sustained strong housing demand in the run-up to the recent house price boom (Chart 6, panel a). This is also reflected in the continued rise of intentions to purchase or build a home to levels not seen since the introduction of the euro. Indeed, the pandemic period appears to have ultimately coincided with an additional boost in demand, likely related to housing relocations in times of an increased preference for remote working.[9]This is in line with a large shock in preferences that some models identify for the pandemic period as compared with what had been observed in previous house price cycles.[10]The subsequent fall in housing demand effectively unwound the exceptional pandemic surge in demand and was relatively limited. Housing investment and transactions declined but show signs of having bottomed out, and intentions to purchase a home have only seen a temporary dent at continued high levels (Chart 6, panel a). This provides the basis for the observed, relatively fast recovery in house prices.Robust growth in disposable income supported housing demand and the debt servicing capacity of euro area households.Unlike in the GFC and SDC downturns, labour market conditions generally remained favourable during the recent house price cycle. Together with income support measures by governments during the pandemic and energy crises, this allowed household income to increase more than mortgage costs and contained the increase in the house price-to-income ratio during the house price boom (Chart 6, panel b). Households could afford higher mortgage payments and the savings accumulated during the pandemic also put them in a position to make larger downpayments. The financial burden for homeowners with a mortgage remained overall relatively low compared both with that for owners without a mortgage or that for tenants paying rents, as well as with what was the relative burden in earlier house price cycles.[11]In contrast to the GFC and SDC cycles, the recent downturn in house prices coincided with robust income developments and the decline in the house price-to-income ratio therefore implied an improvement in affordability that has underpinned the current recovery of house prices despite less favourable financing conditions than at the start of the house price cycle.The role of tighter financing conditions in the adjustment of house prices was mitigated by relatively sound balance sheet positions.The sharp increase in interest rates in response to the 2022 surge in inflation coincided with still substantially overvalued house prices.[12]This could have been expected to lead to a much stronger bust in prices than was ultimately observed. One reason for differences with corresponding adjustments in the GFC and SDC cycles was that these overvaluations coincided with sounder household and bank balance sheet positions than had been the case at the time of the previous two cycles. Much lower mortgage credit growth and a lower debt service ratio compared with the pre-GFC period, which was partly due to the more widespread use of macroprudential policy, also implied more resilient household balance sheets and less risk of a disorderly unwinding of the house price boom, and consequently less volatility in the house price cycle (Chart 7).[13]Moreover, many euro area countries had moved in the direction of a stronger prevalence of fixed rate mortgages, which temporarily protect homeowners from higher borrowing rates and imply lower default rates that could exacerbate house price busts. At the same time, this suggests that, for many households, nominal mortgage payments are likely to increase once their current fixed rate contracts expire and are replaced by those with meanwhile higher interest rates.[14]The recent normalisation of interest rates limits this risk, as it kept the period during which households had to renegotiate their contracts at higher rates rather short. It also ends a short period in which the return on housing as an asset had become less attractive than the return on fixed income investments, which had therefore dampened the demand for housing.[15]The impact of monetary policy tightening on house prices also depends on the link between the housing market and the rental market.If higher interest rates imminently dampen affordability and therefore house purchases, households can be expected to turn more strongly to the rental market to satisfy their demand for shelter.[16]This should put downward pressure on house prices and upward pressure on rental prices (Box 2 discusses the relation between house prices and rental prices). However, the elasticity of households to shift between owning and renting depends on both the general level of rental prices and the availability of let property. In this respect, the tightening of financing conditions has also affected the attractiveness of investing in buy-to-let property and ultimately the supply in the rental market. This holds true even more if prices in the rental market are subject to regulation or if the availability in the rental market is subject to shocks such as immigration.The impact of housing demand and monetary policy factors on house prices also depends on the state of the housing supply.In this respect, the model in Box 1 points to a relatively large role played by supply shocks in the recent house price downturn. This relates to both housing-specific and aggregate supply factors. Building permits, as a proxy for new housing supply, increased since the SDC cycle but remained at substantially lower levels than during the GFC cycle. In the recent house price downturn, they declined sharply reaching historical lows (Chart 8, panel a). This indicates that supply-side shortages prevail, and this helps to explain the relatively short-lived unwinding of house prices and their latest upturn as soon as improved financing conditions started to underpin demand. Economy-wide factors related to supply chain and energy price shocks also affected the construction sector and the supply of housing. Construction costs had risen sharply during the pandemic and post-pandemic periods related to both materials and labour shortages (Chart 8, panel b). This put upward pressure on house prices primarily via house prices for new buildings but also via those for existing buildings where the transaction was conditional upon prior renovation and maintenance. This has, for instance, been the case for measures that increase the energy efficiency of older buildings. The costs of such measures and the corresponding hesitance of potential buyers also help explain why prices for existing dwellings slumped much more than those for new dwellings.Evidence from models and pertinent indicators corroborates the notion that the recent house price cycle exhibited some special features.This relates particularly to the strong upward demand shocks and their likely overlap with a strong preference shock during the house price boom. The pure unwinding of these shocks can explain a substantive part of the subsequent house price bust. The tightening of monetary policy and bank lending standards contributed to the turn of the cycle, despite resilient income fundamentals and constraints in the supply of housing.The latest data confirm that the recent downturn in house prices was relatively mild compared with previous bust periods.By the third quarter of 2024, the level of house prices in the euro area had moved back above the earlier peak level in 2022. While estimates of housing valuations are surrounded by uncertainty, current readings imply that the relatively mild and short-lived decline in house prices implied less adjustment to overvaluations than had been observed during the GFC and the SDC house price cycles (although this adjustment has been more substantial in measures derived on the basis of real house prices). One reason for the limited adjustment is that the bust in house prices took place in a limited number of countries and, therefore, did not bear the same hallmarks as an outright recession as in previous periods, with income fundamentals remaining solid in the most recent house price cycle. In this respect, it resembled an orderly unwinding of the additional boost in house prices recorded during the pandemic period.While a relatively shallow bust in house prices circumvents adverse consequences for household and bank balance sheets, the level of house prices have remained high.This has negatively affected the affordability of housing despite a meanwhile less tight monetary policy. High construction costs and high purchase prices for housing currently stand in the way of generating additional supply in the housing market, which also implies scarcity in the rental market. In view of the combination of supply limitations and continued sound demand fundamentals, house price developments may well continue on their upward path, even though this may not be an entirely healthy outlook for the economy as a whole.',\n",
       "  'Prepared by Colm Bates, Katalin Bodnár, Peter Healy and Marc Roca I LlevadotPublished as part of theECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 1/2025.Wages are key to the assessment of inflation and thus for monetary policy.Inflation both shapes and is shaped by wage developments. Wages represent an input cost to firms. In turn, productivity-adjusted wages affect firms’ price-setting decisions and thus inflationary pressures, while workers base wage claims on current and past inflation and on inflation expectations. Moreover, wages represent a significant part of income for households and therefore affect consumption and saving decisions.The past decade has seen significant changes in the conditions for wage growth, in terms of both price pressures and labour market conditions.The period from 2013 to 2017 was characterised by high albeit declining labour market slack, low inflation and subdued productivity growth which, together with some structural factors, kept a lid on wage growth. While inflation began to gradually pick up from 2018 and labour market tightness was increasing, wage growth remained low.[1]During the pandemic, headline inflation was muted, as were underlying wage dynamics, while both the unemployment rate and wages were affected by government measures to cushion the economic impact of the pandemic shock.[2]Following the post-pandemic reopening of the economy and Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine, inflation in the euro area increased to historically high levels which, combined with a tight labour market, resulted in historically high euro area wage growth. Headline inflation began declining considerably in 2023, while there have also been signs of weakening labour demand and wage growth has gradually been easing from a high level.[3]Such changes in the macroeconomic environment create challenges for assessing the relative importance of the drivers of wages.While lessons can be learned from the low inflation period, the changing economic landscape and data distortions during the pandemic require a reassessment of the standard tools and an extension of data sources used to analyse wage growth. Against this background, this article examines the drivers of wage growth in the extraordinary post-pandemic period (2022-24) through an augmented wage Phillips curve and through the analysis of new, granular data on wage agreements. It also illustrates the link between wage growth and inflation by applying the Bernanke-Blanchard model to the euro area.[4]The events influencing labour market developments after the pandemic had a heterogenous impact on wage indicators (Chart 1).A key indicator in the assessment of wage growth in the euro area is the annual growth rate of compensation per employee (CPE). This reflects the labour costs payable by employers – including wages, salaries and employers’ social contributions – expressed as an average per employee. The ECB monitors various other wage indicators for a more complete assessment of wage pressures, including compensation per hour (CPH) and negotiated wage growth. While CPE growth declined considerably during 2020, indicators of wage growth per hour worked, such as CPH, rose. These developments were driven by statistical factors linked to the pandemic and the use of job retention schemes, which distorted the information content of most wage indicators during this period in various ways. Accordingly, these indicators continued to be volatile in 2021 owing to base effects. By contrast, the ECB’s indicator of negotiated wages, which captures the outcome of collective bargaining processes, was not affected by statistical distortions.[5]It remained relatively stable at a low level during 2020 and 2021.Following the surge in inflation, wage growth increased to levels not seen since before the advent of the monetary union, but different indicators accelerated at different speeds.CPE growth was the first of the wage indicators to follow the rise in euro area inflation, and in 2022 it was already above 4%. At that time CPH growth was about 1 percentage point lower. The difference reflected the recovery of average hours worked after the pandemic, which contributed to CPE growth on top of the more slowly rising hourly compensation. As the growth in average hours worked slowed down, the two measures began to grow at similar rates of above 5% in 2023. In contrast, negotiated wage growth strengthened more gradually, from just above 1% in 2021 to close to 3% in 2022 and above 4% in 2023. This more gradual adjustment reflected the fact that wage negotiations took some time to restart after the pandemic and were lengthy. Much of the difference between CPE and negotiated wages is captured by the wage drift, which made a much stronger than normal contribution to actual wage growth in the early stages of the high inflation period.[6]This high wage drift reflected not only the recovery in average hours worked but also ad hoc inflation compensation at firm level, partly incentivised by preferential tax treatments. As formal wage negotiations began to directly reflect inflation compensation, the wage drift component started to decline again, which was also reflected in a greater similarity between CPE and negotiated wage growth.Recently, wage growth has been moderating from a high level, but again with different indicators moving at different speeds.As in the acceleration phase, negotiated wage growth also seems to be the most persistent and the last to adjust during the period of wage disinflation. While CPE and CPH growth both peaked in the second quarter of 2023, two quarters after the peak in HICP inflation, negotiated wage growth has remained high and volatile, reflecting the fact that wage contracts are of different lengths and workers that were locked into multi-year contracts suffered delays in their wages responding to the surge in inflation. The volatility of the negotiated wage series largely reflects the greater importance of one-off payments in recent years, but base effects due to these payments will have a downward impact in 2025. Information from the ECB wage tracker (see Section 4) and the ECB’s Corporate Telephone Survey also suggests a gradual easing of negotiated wage growth ahead.[7]Shocks in recent years have triggered changes in the drivers of wages.The cyclical position of labour markets, inflation developments and productivity growth are key drivers of wage growth, which economists frequently assess through the lens of a wage Phillips curve. Chart 2 shows how these drivers have developed. To correct for the considerable volatility related to job retention schemes in 2020, we interpolate the wage level and the productivity level – the variables most affected by job retention schemes – over the first and second quarters of 2020. This makes it easier to look through data distortions and understand how recent developments in most of the wage drivers have deviated from historical regularities beyond the distortions induced by the pandemic. Price inflation, captured in Chart 2 through HICP inflation, increased very quickly to historically high levels in 2022 but has returned to close to the ECB’s 2% target more recently. At the same time, the unemployment rate (inverted in the chart) has declined to its lowest level since the introduction of the euro. Finally, labour productivity growth has been below its long-term average for a prolonged period. The ECB’s augmented wage Phillips curve (Nickel, C. et al., op. cit.) captures the impact of these factors – (either past or expected) inflation, labour market state, and productivity – on actual wage growth while also accounting for lags. We will use this tool as a theoretical guide and an empirical device to assess wage developments using a variety of specifications.[8]Catching up with past inflation has been an important driver of recent wage growth.The quick, sizeable and unexpected surge in consumer prices resulted in a decline in real wages across euro area countries and sectors. On average, real wages declined by about 5% between the start of the inflation surge in mid-2021 and the peak of headline inflation (Chart 3). Workers will seek to recoup their real wage losses, meaning that wage demands will reflect the difference between actual real wage levels and real wage expectations, conditional upon labour market conditions.[9]Thus real wage catch-up has been an important driver of recent wage growth. Real wage levels are not included directly in the basic wage Phillips curve, but these can be incorporated indirectly by including past inflation and lagged wage growth in alternative specifications. The assessment of this factor will be enriched by looking at granular wage negotiation data in the next section.It is a priori unclear to what degree wage dynamics reflect past inflation as opposed to forward-looking inflation expectations.This may differ strongly among workers and may also depend on the actual level of inflation. To address this uncertainty, in the augmented wage Phillips curve we capture the impact of inflation on wages by including a measure of either backward or forward-looking inflation, selected from a wide range of possible indicators.[10]All these indicators increased relative to their past values. However, they have deviated strongly since the beginning of the high inflation period (much more so than previously), with backward-looking indicators rising earlier and to a higher level than forward-looking indicators, and longer-term expectations remaining relatively stable (Chart 4).[11]Wage Phillips curve estimations confirm that the reaction of wages to past inflation has been the major driver of recent wage inflation.Although the prevalence of wage indexation is relatively low in the euro area, before the pandemic inflation compensation in wage formation was influenced primarily by backward-looking inflation.[12]Such wage formation may increase the persistence of nominal variables and could amplify second-round effects. Inflation may play a greater role in wage formation in a period of high inflation because firms and workers are more attentive to it than when inflation is low. During the high inflation period and the subsequent disinflation, past inflation and shorter-term inflation expectations explain a larger part of wage developments. Models that include past inflation and short-term inflation expectations can explain a large part of the upward phase of wage growth, while in the wage disinflation phase past inflation appears to have made a somewhat larger contribution. In contrast, models that include long-term inflation expectations point overall to a lower estimated impact of inflation on wage formation (Chart 5). Recently, as HICP inflation has eased, the contribution of inflation to wage growth has also been easing in most specifications with backward-looking or short-term inflation measures, but it nevertheless remains high. Overall, this finding confirms that there is a strong backward-looking element in wage formation in the euro area, which in the recent period is also related to the strong surprise element of the inflationary shock. This is in line with the application of the Bernanke-Blanchard model to the euro area.[13]Various indicators on the state of the labour market have been pointing to tightness, although to different degrees.The period since 2022 has been characterised by the lowest unemployment rate since the introduction of the euro in 1999. The headline unemployment rate has also been lower than estimates of its non-inflationary rate (for example, the European Commission’s non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment – NAWRU), confirming the signals for labour market tightness.[14]Other measures of the labour market state that are used as alternative indicators in the augmented wage Phillips curve specifications (e.g. the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio and the European Commission’s measure of labour as a factor limiting production) have been pointing to an even stronger increase in labour market tightness than the unemployment rate. One possible reason for this is that these two indicators include labour demand more directly, while the unemployment rate reflects the balance between labour demand and labour supply, where adjustments in the labour force may satisfy labour demand. Recently, indicators of labour demand have been easing from a high level, while the unemployment rate has been more stable (Chart 6).Labour market tightness has contributed to recent wage growth.The unemployment rate points to greater upward pressure on wage growth than the historical average. However, since 2022 wage growth has been more closely aligned with the dynamics of the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio and the European Commission’s indicator on labour limiting production. Wage Phillips curve specifications that include these indicators point to a stronger impact of labour market tightness, suggesting they are more informative about wage growth in the recent period (Chart 7). At the same time, the dynamics of recent wage growth more closely follows that of the contribution from (past) inflation, while labour market tightness has likely acted as a supporting factor for real wage catch-up.A wage decomposition based on a range of augmented wage Phillips curve specifications attributes the recent high wage inflation primarily to high price inflation but, as the role of price inflation is declining, the relative impact of the labour market is increasing.In the decomposition, we consider an average of various specifications with different labour market and inflation variables. Comparing the main wage drivers, inflation seems to have been the main driver of wage growth in recent years (Chart 8). The more recent easing of CPE growth is also driven by a lower contribution from inflation. In contrast, the contribution of labour market developments is smaller but is not estimated to have declined.[15]Labour productivity has been weak recently, and this may have dampened overall wage growth. The estimated correlation between productivity and wage growth is very low at the business cycle frequency, and the estimated contribution of productivity to actual CPE growth is very small and primarily negative.[16]Finally, there has been a positive residual, reflecting the presence of some factors which are not captured by the augmented wage Phillips curve models. These factors could be the interplay of labour market tightness and high inflation, but the unexplained part may also reflect the fact that the wage Phillips curve is limited in its ability to capture real wage catch-up.[17]A wage decomposition based on a subset of these augmented wage Phillips curve specifications where the inflation component is only backward-looking increases the relevance of the inflation component and reduces the residual in the post-pandemic era. Such a finding underscores the role the recent high inflation has played in shaping wage growth.The ECB wage tracker provides a timely assessment of negotiated wages.Wage indicators are released with a considerable time lag, and recently, as shown in the previous section, assessing these data has been challenging. In the high inflation period there was a particularly strong need for more timely indicators and approaches. One significant development has been the introduction of the ECB wage tracker, which uses granular data on existing collective bargaining agreements.[20]The ECB wage tracker provides both backward-looking information on negotiated wage growth pressures and very timely forward-looking signals on expected future negotiated wage growth during the coming months.[21]This indicator is one of several new data sources, including survey-based wage indicators, developed at the ECB since the onset of the pandemic.[22]Granular data on wage negotiations can help explain the role of inflation compensation as a driver of such negotiations.The ECB wage tracker made it easier to anticipate the gradual increase in euro area negotiated wages starting in 2022 and to understand the considerable country heterogeneity (Chart 9). In this article, we use this tool to understand the features of wage negotiations using granular data at the agreement level. In particular, we assess the role of real wage catch-up demands in the gradual increase in negotiated wage growth and in the composition of negotiated wages. We differentiate between structural increases – i.e. changes that affect base wages – and one-off payments, and we assess the role of institutional factors in the pace of real wage catch-up.[23]One important factor behind the heterogenous speed of adjustment of negotiated wages to inflation is the length of previous collective bargaining agreements.Institutional factors, such as the frequency of collective bargaining negotiations and the length of agreements, can influence the dynamics of underlying wage pressures. Understanding how quickly social partners can react to economic shocks and renegotiate collective bargaining agreements is therefore key to assessing the pass-through of inflation to wages. Long contract durations limit the scope for employers to adjust to macroeconomic shocks but, at the same time, provide a safeguard for employees regarding their future compensation, as it is less dependent on the business cycle. However, in a high inflation period, long contract durations can lead to substantial real wage losses, especially when the strong inflationary shocks were not accounted for in the previous wage negotiation. Long contract duration can also increase the volatility of negotiated wage series when inflation is unexpectedly high, since in this case there is a large accumulated real wage gap to be closed or narrowed in future wage negotiations. For example, retail and wholesale sector workers in Germany recently negotiated a new wage agreement for the first time in three years. To compensate for the cumulated real wage loss, they agreed large one-off payments as well as significant structural wage increases (i.e. growth in regular payments, excluding one-offs) in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in record negotiated wage growth (as shown in Chart 1).ECB wage tracker data suggest that recorded contract durations differ greatly within the euro area.In France and Austria, collective bargaining agreements last on average around 12 months. By contrast, in Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, agreements are usually valid for two years or more. In Italy and Spain, the distribution of workers by contract duration exhibits several peaks, some at significant intervals such as five or six years, which is uncommon in other countries (Chart 10, panel a). Aggregating the ECB wage tracker data at the euro area level reveals that 13% of workers are covered by contracts lasting one year or less and which have been renegotiated at least three times since 2021. As the contract duration lengthens, the renegotiation frequency naturally decreases. One-third of workers have contracts lasting one to two years, and there have been a large number of agreements in this segment since 2021, reflecting the sometimes staggered and slow nature of collective bargaining. Contracts with a duration longer than two years, which cover 54% of workers, have been renegotiated only once or twice since 2021 (Chart 10, panel b).Shorter contracts enable wage growth to respond more quickly to inflation.Structural wage growth among contracts renegotiated every year increased from 2.0% in 2021 to 5.1% in 2022 and 6.0% in 2023, before easing to 3.5% in 2024. While these contracts still reflect staggered wage dynamics, they suggest that negotiated wage pressures will continue to ease as long as inflation does not suddenly increase again. Contracts with longer durations display a more gradual structural wage adjustment, with lower recorded wage growth in 2022 and higher wage growth in 2023 and 2024. Thus, contracts with longer durations displayed a weaker immediate response to the inflation surge in 2022 and stickier and higher wage growth in the subsequent years. Still, wage pressures for longer duration contracts are also easing, as already seen in 2024 in the wage growth dynamics of contracts with an average duration of two years (Chart 11).As most of the workers covered by the ECB wage tracker have renegotiated their wages since the start of the inflation surge, real wage catch-up is easing as a factor, as confirmed by the forward-looking tracker.A significant share of collective bargaining agreements expired in 2024, affecting more than 30% of the workers covered by the ECB wage tracker database. Moreover, a further 15% will see their agreements expire in the first half of 2025. Of these, a substantial majority were agreed in either 2023 or 2024, suggesting that most workers have already received wage increases or one-off payments compensating for inflation. Very few of the contracts that are expected to be renegotiated by the second quarter of 2025 have not already been renewed at least once since 2023. Accordingly, the vast majority of contract renegotiations are anticipated to result in lower wage growth than was agreed in 2023 and 2024, driven partly by the more flexible, or less staggered, wage adjustment of contracts with lower durations (Chart 12). This, together with the lower wage drift, will bring overall wage pressures down.As the unusual shocks of recent years are slowly dissipating, wage growth is gradually easing.Wage growth is an important factor influencing the inflation outlook, and understanding its drivers is crucial. The augmented wage Phillips curve approach points to real wage catch-up as the main driver of recent high wage growth, which was supported by tight labour markets. In contrast, productivity growth has played a negligible role. The estimated inflationary impact reflects developments in past inflation and captures – although imperfectly – the real wage catch-up process. This factor is slowly dissipating, as is also confirmed by granular data in the ECB wage tracker, allowing wage growth to edge down, which is further supported by the easing of labour demand. At the same time, the wage channel is playing a key role in explaining inflation dynamics, so it remains important to monitor wage developments.',\n",

The reformed SGP aims at ensuring sustainable fiscal positions, which are key for price stability and sustainable growth in a smoothly functioning Economic and Monetary Union. In addition, the SGP aims to balance fiscal adjustment needs with the need to enhance the implementation of productive investment and reforms, with a particular focus on strategically relevant areas such as the green and digital transitions and defence.The submission and endorsement of the first set of national medium-term fiscal-structural plans (MFSPs) was a milestone in the implementation of the reformed economic governance framework.Last year EU Member States prepared the first set of MFSPs under the reformed economic governance framework. As a rule, such plans span four or five years, depending on the length of the national electoral cycle. In the plans, each EU Member State commits to a multi-year public net expenditure path and explains how it will deliver investments and reforms that respond to the main challenges identified in the context of the European Semester.[2]The EU’s Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN Council) endorsed the MFSPs of most Member States, issuing corresponding recommendations on 21 January 2025.[3]In view of heightened geopolitical tensions and the need to step up defence capabilities in Europe, on 19 March 2025 the European Commission proposed a coordinated activation of the “national escape clause”.This clause had already been introduced as part of the reform of the SGP and will allow Member States to deviate – on grounds of higher defence expenditure – from the net expenditure paths set out in their MFSPs or from their corrective path under the excessive deficit procedure (EDP). If already endorsed by the ECOFIN Council, the MFSPs of the Member States will not need to be revised for additional defence spending. There is flexibility for such additional spending on defence, up to a limit of 1.5 percentage points of GDP per year over 2025-28 compared with existing fiscal commitments, in countries that choose to request the activation of the national escape clause. However, the SGP framework requires that deviations from the endorsed net expenditure paths do not endanger fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Countries which have not yet submitted plans, or the MFSP of which has not yet been endorsed, are expected to receive equivalent treatment to the other Member States when requesting activation of the national escape clause.This article reviews the MFSPs to provide a first assessment both of the fiscal and economic implications of the reformed SGP over the short and medium term and of the implications of coordinated activation of the national escape clause.Section 2 recalls how the requirements of the reformed fiscal rules compare with the previous regime. Section\\xa03 reviews the fiscal paths outlined in the MFSPs and assesses risks to the outlook for government debt (Box 1) as well as growth and inflation. Section 4 discusses the European Commission’s proposal to provide flexibility for defence spending within the SGP. Section 5 aims to establish whether the revised SGP will trigger additional reforms and investment, and Section 6 concludes.The new risk-based surveillance approach under the reformed SGP builds on Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) to guide fiscal adjustment paths so that government debt is brought onto a plausibly declining path by the end of an adjustment period.This period can be either four years, or up to seven if an extension is granted.[4]This approach is complemented by so-called numerical safeguards for deficit and debt reduction as well as minimum requirements when a country is subject to an EDP.[5]In June last year each Member State with a debt ratio above 60% of GDP and/or a deficit ratio above 3% of GDP in 2024 received a “reference trajectory” from the European Commission as prior guidance. Those Member States with low deficit and debt ratios received technical information, if requested. A reference trajectory spells out fiscal adjustment requirements in terms of maximum growth rates for net expenditure.[6]These are derived from the changes in the structural primary balance that underlie the DSA. The net expenditure concept serves as the single operational indicator under the revised fiscal governance framework, replacing the previous surveillance approach that built on the structural budget balance, i.e. the cyclically adjusted balance net of temporary measures. A control account will monitor deviations from these net expenditure paths, possibly triggering a debt-based EDP if cumulated deviations exceed certain numerical thresholds.[7]Compared with the previous regime, the risk-based surveillance approach implies more differentiated fiscal adjustment requirements (Chart 1).Under the previous SGP framework, Member States had to converge towards medium-term budgetary objectives, i.e. close-to-balance underlying fiscal positions. Annual adjustment requirements were calibrated based on a “matrix approach”, accounting for cyclical conditions and the level of debt. Effectively, country differentiation was limited – despite large differences in the levels of government debt. The new approach rests on the projected evolution of public debt. Accordingly, it recognises that fiscal discipline is an intertemporal issue, implying higher adjustment requirements where debt challenges are more pronounced and/or where initial budgetary positions are less favourable. Chart 1 highlights the fact that several Member States with low indebtedness are facing very limited adjustment requirements under the revised fiscal framework – or even have room for stimulus. This holds for the requirements under the default four-year adjustment period as compared with the requirements which would have applied going forward if the previous SGP had remained in place. However, for several countries with elevated debt ratios the requirements lie mostly well above historical observed adjustments before the pandemic. In most cases the adjustments delivered were significantly lower than the average historical requirements, which were around 0.5% of GDP.The option to extend the adjustment period from four years to seven years, in return for commitments to structural reforms and public investment, potentially provides sizeable room for fiscal manoeuvre.[8]The reformed framework recognises the medium-term benefits of productive public investment and productivity-enhancing structural reforms for fiscal sustainability. Such beneficial effects materialise via the denominator effect: higher economic growth translates into a lower debt-to-GDP ratio. Therefore, Member States can opt for an extended seven-year adjustment period if this is supported by respective policy commitments. Chart 1 shows that adjustment requirements can be reduced significantly by opting for an extended adjustment period (the blue bars indicate the average annual adjustment with an extension, while the orange bars quantify the additional adjustment that would be required in the standard four-year scenario).On 21 January 2025 the ECOFIN Council adopted the Commission’s recommendations to endorse 15 of the 16 MFSPs submitted by euro area Member States.[9]Belgium submitted its MFSP on 19 March and neither a Commission assessment nor an ECOFIN Council decision are available as yet. Three euro area countries have not yet submitted their plans, namely Germany, Lithuania and Austria.So far, only 5 of the 17 euro area countries that have submitted MFSPs have opted for an extended adjustment period by committing to reforms and investment – though these countries represent half of the euro area economy.Specifically, Belgium, Spain, France, Italy and Finlandhave opted to extend the adjustment period by three years and committed to a relevant set of reforms and investments (Chart 2, panel a).A number of euro area countries accounting for over two-fifths of euro area GDP have either not submitted a plan or are considered to lack political backing for the submitted plan, posing risks to the near-term fiscal outlook (Chart 2, panel b).Spain has submitted its MFSP, but its Parliament has not been able to pass the draft budget for 2025. Germany, Lithuania and Austria have still to submit their plans.Several MFSPs deviate from the European Commission’s prior fiscal guidance, mostly reflecting updated budgetary and macroeconomic information.The planned cumulative net expenditure growth rates are higher than those of the Commission’s reference trajectories in most Member States, as indicated by values above the 45-degree line in Chart 3, panel a. The differences mainly relate to the fact that the initial Commission guidance had been provided to Member States on 21 June 2024, while MFSPs were only submitted later, in the autumn. By then more recent information was available on the fiscal positions in 2024 that served as the starting point for the DSA-based adjustment requirements. Updated macroeconomic assumptions were mostly assessed as duly justified by the Commission, but highlight how sensitive the new fiscal framework is to the assumptions made (see Box 1).All Member States facing high debt sustainability risks have to plan for lower average net expenditure growth rates, also because their primary spending ratios are comparatively large.As shown in Chart 3, panel c, some of these countries record primary spending ratios of about 40% of GDP or above. Given that the net expenditure growth rates are derived from these ratios, the higher these are, the lower the expenditure growth ceilings must be to achieve the same amount of fiscal adjustment. Equally, where the fiscal efforts required are higher in terms of improvement in the structural primary balance ratio, this implies lower net expenditure growth, on average, in the MFSPs.The fiscal adjustment efforts in the MFSPs appear to be in line with the “no backloading” requirement in the revised economic governance framework.Chart 4 shows that the average improvement in the structural primary balance position over the first two years of the plans (2025 and 2026) is, in the vast majority of cases, either equal to or greater than the average adjustment planned for 2025‑28. This suggests that Member States do not plan to backload their fiscal adjustment to the years towards the end of the planning period.The European Commission’sOpinionson the 2025 draft budgetary plans of the euro area countries suggest, in some cases, fiscal gaps vis-à-vis the net expenditure paths contained in the MFSPs, resulting in debits on the control account.Box 1 highlights that such debits, if combined with a resetting of the account by a newly appointed government, can materially reduce the consolidation effort over the MFSP horizon. As shown above, such consolidation efforts already tend to be lower than figures derived from the Commission’s reference trajectories and their underlying assumptions. Such deviations from the reference trajectory can have tangible adverse effects on the debt trajectory, in particular for countries with high debt ratios.Finally, before the announcements on defence spending flexibility, Eurosystem staff assessed that consolidation efforts under the revised SGP would have limited adverse macroeconomic effects overall, particularly if productive public investment is at least maintained.The macroeconomic implications of the consolidation needs under the revised EU framework are relevant for a comprehensive assessment of the new SGP rules. A preliminary analysis in early 2024, before countries started submitting MFSPs, found that abiding fully by the SGP consolidation requirements would imply some short-term downside risks to growth at the euro area level and muted effects on inflation.[10]An updated analysis for the period 2025-27, as part of the 2024 December Eurosystem staff projections, takes into account the new information in the MFSPs and the 2025 draft budgetary plans. In particular, it incorporates the chosen adjustment periods and the planned structural efforts. It broadly confirms the previous assessment of limited adverse macroeconomic effects.[11]Some of the measures outlined in the government plans – those measures well specified – were included in the December baseline projections. Overall this induced slight revisions to the baseline growth and inflation projections.[12]Theestimated macroeconomic and fiscal effects are surrounded by uncertainty. This is especially the case for those countries which have not yet submitted an MFSP or where the plan is already outdated. Another source of uncertainty is the potentially different composition of the consolidation ultimately implemented by governments. Moreover, in the absence of fiscal adjustment, confidence effects may play an important role – especially in the high-debt countries. Finally, the additional potential defence spending allowed under the rules in the context of heightened geopolitical tensions has increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the euro area. An increase in defence and infrastructure spending could add to growth and also raise inflation through its effect on aggregate demand.[13]Following the endorsement of the MFSPs of most EU Member States by the ECOFIN Council and in light of geopolitical developments, in March 2025 the European Commission proposed the coordinated activation of the national escape clause under the SGP.This was part of the European Commission’s ReArm Europe Plan/Readiness 2030, as announced on 19 March 2025.[14]In early March EU leaders had welcomed the Commission’s stated intention to recommend that the Council activate, in a coordinated manner, the national escape clause under the SGP. The Commission was also called on to explore further measures to facilitate significant defence spending at national level in all Member States while ensuring debt sustainability.[15]It provided greater detail on the implementation of the national escape clause in aCommunicationpublished on 19 March.The Commission will activate the national escape clause in the SGP on grounds of exceptional circumstances outside the control of Member States, which has important implications for the implementation of the MFSPs.Specifically, Member States will need to submit their requests by the end of April. Activating the clause allows a Member State to deviate from its net expenditure path as set by the ECOFIN Council or from the corrective path under the EDP,provided that such deviation does not endanger fiscal sustainability over the medium term. The budgetary flexibility for Member States activating this clause will be granted on two conditions. First, there will be a cap of 1.5% of GDP on additional spending per year for 2025-28 – for each Member State irrespective of its distance to/from NATO’s 2% of GDP target for defence expenditure. Any increases beyond that cap will be subject to the usual assessments of compliance. Second, the additional fiscal space is to be used for extra defence expenditures and is to include both investment and current expenditure.[16]The increase in defence expenditure covered by flexibility under the national escape clause will be calculated relative to 2021 – the reference year. After 2028, Member States will have to sustain the higher spending level through gradual reprioritisation within their national budgets in order to safeguard fiscal sustainability.Apart from the flexibility granted for defence spending, the fiscal framework should continue to operate normally.Concretely, the net expenditure growth ceilings of Member States as set out in their MFSPs remain valid. This implies that EU fiscal surveillance will monitor countries’ compliance with the net expenditure paths included in the national plans and – where applicable – the EDP recommendations. The assessment of compliance with agreed spending ceilings is, however, to be conducted in a way that nets out the amount of defence spending subject to the escape clause. Therefore, in the absence of compensatory measures, debt trajectories would deviate from those projected at the time of endorsement. The implications of the triggering of national escape clauses for additional defence spending are analysed in Box 1.Another key design feature of the revised governance framework is its aim of fostering productive investment and growth-enhancing reforms.[20]Member States opting for an extension need to make sure that the planned level of nationally financed public investment is no lower during the MFSP period than its previous medium-term level. The European Commission operationalises this by comparing the average ratio to GDP of nationally financed public investment over the planning period with the average level over the period covered by the respective Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP), i.e. 2021/22 to 2026. In its assessments of the MFSPs, the Commission finds that four euro area countries that have opted for an extension of the adjustment period so far meet the condition (Spain, France, Italy and Finland).[21]The revised rules require that countries seeking an extension of their fiscal adjustment period commit to a set of adequate reforms, thereby increasing reform incentives. These reforms should respond to the main policy challenges identified in the context of the European Semester. Ultimately, the reforms in the national plans should lead to higher potential output growth and thereby reduce fiscal adjustment needs.Nationally financed public investment is planned to remain at or above average pre-pandemic levels in all five euro area countries that opted for an extended adjustment period.Chart 5 compares nationally financed government investments as a percentage of GDP over 2025-28 with the average for 2014-19. This average can provide additional insights relative to the Commission’s operationalisation, because the period concerned was not affected by the large investments foreseen in the RRPs. The national plans for Belgium, Spain, Italy and Finland aim at reaching a level of nationally financed government investment that is, on average, significantly above the 2014-19 average. Only the French plan maintains nationally financed government investment broadly at the levels observed in 2014-19. Public investment commitments in the MFSPs appear to mostly overlap or complement existing measures included in the RRPs. In Iine with the revised economic governance framework, the Commission assesses these as addressing the common priorities of the EU, including the green and digital transitions.The reforms supporting an extension of the adjustment period focus mainly on the public sector.The plans of the five euro area countries seeking an extension of the adjustment period include 71 extension-related reforms. Half of them can be broadly categorised as public sector reforms, for instance aiming to enhance tax administration or the judiciary (Chart 6). Labour market, education and social policies account for around one-fifth of all planned reforms. The categories “business environment” and “green/digital framework conditions” account for 15% and 12%, respectively. The remaining reforms are related to financial policies (4%), most notably insolvency frameworks and the housing market. With its focus on public sector reforms, the reform mix in the fiscal-structural plans is therefore comparable to that envisaged by the RRPs.[22]Most of the planned reforms are either already included in the RRPs or designed to complement them.While the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) is in operation, the revised governance framework allows Member States to include in their MFSPs reforms that have already been implemented or planned in the context of the RRPs. Some 37% of the reforms underpinning an extension of the adjustment period fall into this category (Chart 7). Another 37% of the relevant reforms are designed to complement or extend those set out in the RRPs. The remaining 26% can be seen as new, stand-alone reforms without a direct connection to the RRPs, such as the planned streamlining and improvement of the efficiency of state-owned enterprises in Italy.The growth impact of the suggested reforms is difficult to assess.First, there is no agreed methodology for determining the potential quantitative impact of reforms on the fiscal adjustment required under the new rules.[23]Among the five euro area countries seeking an extension of the adjustment period, only Spain and Italy provide comprehensive estimates of the expected growth impact that, though not comparable, are based on specific models or comparisons with baseline scenarios. Second, so far the reforms are only public commitments – important parameters concerning the design and implementation of the reforms are still to be decided. Therefore, the overall impact on potential output growth is hard to quantify.The implementation of the reformed economic governance framework is surrounded by significant uncertainty.Although fiscal surveillance under the SGP framework is envisaged to continue to operate normally, it needs to take into account a coordinated activation of the national escape clause of the SGP. Such activation also follows a prolonged period (2020-23) in which the general escape clause of the SGP had already been activated, implying a de facto suspension of the European fiscal rules. In addition to challenges related to the escape clause, the uncertainty relates to the fact that some countries have yet to submit a plan or their plan lacks political backing. Moreover, future plans will need to rest on prior guidance from the European Commission based on more recent forecasts, factoring in recent shifts in the political and economic context. Overall, the course of fiscal policy in the euro area in 2025 and beyond remains surrounded by high uncertainty, not least as Member States still have to spell out their plans regarding defence.In view of high uncertainty, full implementation of the commitments undertaken in Member States’ MFSPs is crucial.As the SGP rules continue to be implemented, Member States should fully implement their fiscal and structural commitments as this will also help limit the deficit and debt-increasing impact of additional spending on defence. Fiscal consolidation measures need to be well-designed, and accompanied by growth-enhancing reforms and public investment, to limit adverse macroeconomic effects through aggregate demand. And the latter would in part be offset by confidence effects, notably in high-debt countries.The national escape clause needs to be implemented in a targeted way, that ensures a rise in defence spending while preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability in line with the requirements of the SGP.In this context, it is essential that flexibility to deviate from an endorsed net expenditure path is only used for the necessary additional defence spending, as envisaged by the Commission in its Communication. This will be important to preserve the credibility of the recently reformed EU fiscal framework, thus achieving the defence spending goals without endangering medium-term fiscal sustainability. Deviations from the net expenditure paths should continue to be recorded in order to ensure normal surveillance of compliance with the commitments in the plans.Appropriate surveillance and monitoring of fiscal adjustment, reform and investment commitments will be crucial to ensure that the objectives of the revised fiscal and economic governance framework are met.The framework builds on the premise that fiscal sustainability, reforms and investment are mutually reinforcing and should therefore be fostered as part of an integrated approach. ECB staff estimates suggest that gaps in the fiscal adjustment vis-à-vis the net expenditure ceilings of the MFSPs could emerge in the near term. Such gaps – if sizeable and persistent – may interfere with the objective of the new framework, namely putting debt on a plausibly declining path over the medium term, especially in view of the need for additional spending on defence. It is important that Member States do not use the flexibility offered by the control account ex ante, this being intended to be used to monitor deviations from agreed consolidation paths rather than provide additional fiscal space. Going forward, proper surveillance of the implementation of the plans will be crucial to ensure that the comprehensive new governance framework gains credibility and delivers on its stated objectives from the start.Finally, the plan’s reform and investment initiatives will need to be implemented effectively.It will be essential to sustain national public investment, in line with the commitments contained in the MFSPs, in order to also address challenges in strategic areas other than defence, such as the green and digital transitions. Member States’ plans also contain important reform initiatives, which significantly overlap with or complement existing commitments under the Next Generation EU programme. The reforms and investments, if well implemented, can raise potential growth, thereby providing an important contribution to the sustainability of public finances. If anything, the most recent challenges that Europe has been confronted with have strengthened the case for stepping up efforts to bring about sustainably higher economic growth.',\n",
       "  'Prepared by Malin Andersson, Petra Köhler-Ulbrich and Carolin Nerlich[1]Published as part of theECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 1/2025.The green transition towards a climate-neutral economy is a key challenge for the EU and requires substantial investment to 2030 and beyond.Climate-related disasters are increasing in frequency and severity in Europe and elsewhere, pointing to substantial investment needs to speedily decarbonise the economy and adapt the EU to a changing climate. Estimates of the additional amount that should be invested in capital expenditure and low carbon-emitting durable consumption goods each year until the end of this decade range from 2.7% to 3.7% of 2023 EU GDP. A delay in the decarbonisation, in particular at the global level, would push up transition and adaptation costs even further. At the same time, an investment-led transition towards a low-carbon economy will entail a wide-ranging structural shift, which is expected to affect growth and prices as well as the financial sector. For all these reasons, the ECB is carefully monitoring developments, as outlined in this article.[2]Substantial amounts of funds will be required for the green transition.To achieve the above aims, the contribution of the private sector to funding green investment will be key, also given current public finance constraints. While bank financing is expected to make a vital contribution to the green transition, capital markets in Europe will need to expand and integrate more fully to better support green innovation and start-ups. The public sector can play an important role in fostering private investment in the green transition by reducing the financing costs of borrowers and de-risking green investment activities, albeit within the bounds of the available fiscal space.A combination of structural reforms and good business conditions is crucial to underpin the green transition.Obstacles to the green transition include the limited availability of skilled staff in the field of clean and sustainable technologies, the challenges of setting up green businesses and uncertainty about future climate strategies. Public policies should aim to remove structural rigidities, improve regulatory and administrative efficiency and foster green innovation. Structural reforms can incentivise firms, households and investors to step up green investment activities.Against this background, this article assesses the green investment needs in the EU and the ways that these can be financed.In Section 2, a range of estimates of green investment needs prepared by several institutions is assessed. Section 3 contains a discussion on the role of the private sector, especially banks, in financing the green transition, as well as the role of the public sector in supporting green investment. Section 4 reviews the main obstacles to the green transition and policy options to address them. Section 5 concludes.[3]Substantial investment is needed in the EU in the coming decades to enable the green transition, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.Analysis by the European Commission shows that, in the period from 2011 to 2020, an average of €764 billion was invested in the EU each year to reduce GHG emissions (Chart 1, panel a). This is about 5.1% of the EU’s GDP in 2023. To reach the 2030 target, the Commission estimates that an additional €477 billion of green investment will be needed each year, equivalent to 3.2% of 2023 GDP.[4]In sum, total green investment of around €1.2 trillion each year, equivalent to 8.3% of 2023 GDP, is needed. The definition of green investment used here is broader than that used under gross fixed capital formation in national accounts, as it includes low carbon-emitting durable consumption goods such as electric vehicles. It is important to stress that a substantial part of this investment, as further discussed below, is not additional but rather substitution for investment goods and purchases of durable goods which are not considered “green”. For example, purchases of electric cars will substitute acquisitions of fuel combustion engine cars. The same applies to the installation of new domestic heating systems.Estimates of green investment needs differ across institutions, both for total investment and the additional amounts needed.Compared with those of the European Commission, the figures for total green investment needs presented by other institutions are considerably smaller, mostly due to lower historical estimates (Chart 1, panel a). Focusing on the estimates of additional green investment needs − the amounts needed each year on top of continued investment of past amounts – these range between €558 billion according to BloombergNEF (BNEF) and around €400 billion according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Institute for Climate Economics (I4CE) until 2030. This implies that additional amounts of green investment between 2.7% and 3.7% of 2023 EU GDP will be needed each year until the end of this decade. As assessments of green investment needs involve a high degree of uncertainty, most studies rely on a variety of scenarios.[5]The variations can be attributed mainly to differences in the coverage and definition of the sectors as well as the underlying methodologies.The estimates vary depending on whether the full costs of green investments are considered or only the additional costs compared with legacy technologies. For example, the estimates for the transport sector by the European Commission and I4CE include the full production cost of electric vehicles, while the IEA only considers the battery costs. Moreover, estimates depend on the coverage and definition of the sectors included. BNEF and the IEA, for instance, include investments in hydrogen, nuclear and carbon capture, while only BNEF includes green investment in shipping. Furthermore, the estimated investment needed to increase the energy efficiency of buildings varies widely across institutions, and some institutions do not capture the building sector in their estimates.Zooming in on the sectoral estimates, investment needs vary significantly across sectors.According to the European Commission, in absolute terms most investment is needed in the transport sector, with a total of €754 billion per year required for its transition towards carbon neutrality (Chart 1, panel b). By far the largest share, amounting to around 80%, relates to investment in road transport, which includes passenger transport and the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles but also goods transport. In relative terms, by contrast, the largest increase in green investment will be needed in clean energy supply. Compared with historical averages, investment in this sector will need to increase by a factor of around 1.7 annually until 2030 to decarbonise energy supply.The estimates for additional green investment needs can be seen as a lower bound in view of investment shortfalls and the only selective coverage of sectors.Despite recent progress, Europe’s green investment activities have so far fallen short of what would have been needed annually until 2030 to achieve the decarbonisation target. Slippages were particularly noticeable during the pandemic. To compensate for the considerable shortfall compared with the target levels, more investment will be required in the remaining years to 2030.[6]If this is not achieved, a delay in the green transition would imply additional costs for adaptation.[7]Possible reasons for the shortfalls are poor access to, or high costs of, finance and a policy framework that fails to support, or even hinders, the green transition, as discussed below. Another reason why the estimates of annual investment may be understating the actual needs relates to the sectoral coverage. As mentioned above, some estimates do not include the full spectrum of sectors that will be impacted by the green transition. Taken together, this all means that the estimates outlined here should be considered a lower bound.The green transition requires substantial funding, in particular by the private sector but with support from the public sector.This section looks at both of these sources of finance.Banks are expected to play a crucial role in financing the green transition in the euro area.The green transition requires substantial amounts of funding, largely expected to be provided by the private sector. Given that loans from euro area banks account for nearly 60% of the stock of debt finance of euro area non-financial corporations and for more than 80% of the stock of debt of euro area households, banks make a key contribution to the financing of those activities that result in the release of carbon emissions.[8]Banks are therefore expected to play an important role in the financing of the green transition. The amount of carbon emitted by corporates in the euro area that can be linked to funding from euro area banks trended down overall from 2018 to 2021, but banks continued to be highly exposed to firms’ carbon emissions (Chart 2).[9]This exposure varies widely across industries, but is particularly large in the manufacturing, energy and transport sectors, which underscores the challenges these sectors still have ahead of them in the green transition.Banks consider climate risks in their lending conditions, in terms of both transition and physical risks.In a specific climate-related question in the July 2024euro area bank lending survey(BLS), banks reported that they grant a climate-related discount to firms with low carbon emissions and firms demonstrating considerable progress in their green transition (Chart 3, panel a). By contrast, high-emitting firms which may have so far postponed producing a credible green transition plan or have made little progress in that regard are charged a climate risk premium in their lending conditions. Banks may also reject a loan application if they have doubts regarding the sustainability of a firm’s business model or perceive a higher risk of corporate default in the medium term.[10]This demonstrates that banks recognise firms’ transition risk as a relevant credit risk leading to tighter credit conditions (Chart 3, panel b). In addition, the financing of investment in innovative green technologies typically entails higher credit risk, making their funding more costly. Banks also assess a firm’s physical risk, often linked to its geographic location, as a relevant risk in their climate-related credit assessment, as this can affect the value of collateral and the firm’s value more generally (blue bars in Chart 3, panel b). They expect the relevance of these climate-related risks to increase over time (yellow bars).Climate-related fiscal support improves the likelihood of a loan being approved and mitigates the financing costs for firms, facilitating investment in the green transition.According to banks participating in the BLS, climate-related fiscal support, in the form of state guarantees or subsidies for example, can help to reduce banks’ exposure to climate risks, thereby easing credit conditions and helping to boost loan demand (Chart 3, panel b). However, banks indicated in the July 2024 BLS that the actual beneficial impact of climate-related fiscal support on bank lending conditions over the previous 12 months (blue bars) was substantially lower than they had expected a year earlier (yellow bars). The positive impact that fiscal support can have on firms’ green investment decisions is also confirmed by the firms themselves, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Meanwhile, large firms point in particular to the important role played by retained earnings as a source of funding for planned green investment, while capital markets still play a smaller role (Chart 4).[11]Financial markets can help to speed up the green transition, also by providing funding for riskier projects and green innovation, although these market segments are still small.Market-based financing involving the issuance of sustainable debt securities still plays only a limited role in the euro area, accounting for around 7% of the stock of all debt securities issued, with green bonds constituting the largest market segment (Chart 5).[12]While the market share of sustainable debt securities has grown rapidly over recent years, growth has slowed somewhat of late, especially for sustainability-linked bonds. Other market-based sources of funding, like private equity, play only a minor role in the EU.[13]Private funding needs to be supported by public sector action.Support from the public sector can come either directly in the form of public investment or indirectly in the form of subsidies or state guarantees. It can incentivise private green investment by reducing borrowers’ financing costs and de-risking green investment activities for firms and potential creditors alike. Helping the private sector to invest in the green transition can be particularly beneficial due to the high level of uncertainty surrounding the rate of return when financing innovation and new technologies. At the same, fiscal space for extensive public sector support is constrained by the requirement to preserve fiscal sustainability in Europe.At the EU level, public funds are supporting the green transition, with the largest contribution coming from the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).For the current EU budgetary period 2021-27, there is a requirement for at least 30% of the combined funds from the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme to contribute to climate objectives.[14]The RRF, which is the centrepiece of the NGEU programme, provides the largest share (€276 billion) of the total funds made available by the European Commission to support climate objectives (€658 billion; Chart 6, panel a).[15]Further public funds are provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB), by auction revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and by national policy initiatives.The single largest share of the climate-related RRF funds goes to firms, but so far the absorption rate of these funds has been low (Chart 6, panel b).The support measures offered to firms, amounting to 43% of the climate-related RRF funds, come mostly in the form of subsidies and tax credits which aim to promote green investments in areas such as energy infrastructure, company electric vehicles and greater building energy efficiency. So far, however, the absorption rate of these funds has generally been low.[16]By mid-2024 only 20% (around €55 billion) of the climate-related RRF funds had been disbursed, with the remainder still available to be spent until the end of 2026. The low absorption rate may be partly related to bottlenecks caused by insufficient administrative capacity and complex governance structures. The performance-based nature of the RRF means that financial support is not provided until pre-defined milestones and targets have been met. By contrast, as much as 40% (around €150 billion) of the climate-related funds committed under the current MFF had been disbursed by the end of 2023.The available EU funds can largely cover the public green investment needs up to 2026, although a green public funding gap may open up when the RRF expires.No benchmark has been established yet to determine the optimal role of the public sector in mitigating climate change. That said, a broad estimate of the public share of the additional investment needs may be derived from the weighted public investment share of each sector.[17]This stylised exercise results in an overall public sector share of around 17% of the additional climate-related investment needs over the period from 2021 to 2030, which is equivalent to around €83 billion per year.[18]Compared with the available EU funds and under the assumption of full disbursement of the RRF funds by the end of 2026, the green public funding gap would be limited to an average of €20 billion per year (around 24% of the public funding needs) between 2025 and 2030. This result is sensitive to the underlying assumptions, however, especially the full use of the RRF envelope. The green public funding gap is likely to become substantially larger after the RRF expires at the end of 2026 (green bars in Chart 6, panel b). Yet, limited EU public funds after 2026 may reduce the ability of the public sector to crowd in private investment.[19]Structural reforms will also play an important role in supporting the transition to a climate-neutral economy.The green transition requires an institutional framework and structural reforms that facilitate the reallocation of resources from high-carbon to low-carbon activities, incentivise green innovation and new business models, and provide a favourable environment for the deployment and diffusion of low-carbon technologies.However, a recent survey by the European Patent Office (EPO) and the EIB revealed major structural barriers to green investment, with for instance the availability of finance being more problematic here than for investing firms in general.[20]Around 30% of cleantech firms stated that issues with the availability of finance acted as a major obstacle to investment.[21]This is twice the share reported by the broader range of non-financial firms surveyed in the wider EIB Investment Survey (Chart 7).[22]Skill shortages and regulatory barriers including complex and diverse regulations across the EU are major challenges for firms. Other bottlenecks include difficulties in finding demand for new products and services, as well as the high cost and complexity of finding and negotiating with business partners. Policies to improve the quality of education, upskilling and reskilling of the labour force as well as to spur labour mobility to green sectors are key to support green investment.[23]The recently published report authored by Mario Draghi highlights the key role that simplifying and harmonising regulations at national and EU levels can play in supporting innovation and the scaling-up of EU firms.[24]This could be achieved by creating a European Innovative Company (EIC) label, for instance, under which EU companies would be able to operate under a limited and harmonised set of legal obligations covering corporate law, insolvency procedures and some key aspects of labour and tax law.[25]Carbon taxation, which is widely seen as the most efficient policy instrument to incentivise private investment in the green transition, is expected to increase.[26]In Europe, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) works indirectly as a carbon tax, with the carbon price being determined by auctions of emission permits. A new EU ETS2 will be introduced in 2027 to cover emissions from building heating and transport.[27]In addition, several EU Member States have explicit carbon taxes in place, though often with a limited tax base and rate. The effective carbon rate, which combines EU ETS prices, actual carbon taxes and fuel excise taxes, is still well below the effective carbon rate that would be needed to achieve the 2030 emission reduction target in the absence of other measures.[28]Finally, it is vital to advance the capital markets union agenda, also for the green transition.More sophisticated venture capital markets would make it easier for innovative EU firms to access risk capital and to grow. In addition, well-designed savings products would help to channel European savings towards longer-term, higher-return investments.[29]In particular, patents are important to attract venture capital and serve as debt collateral.[30]Capital market imperfections such as asymmetric information may discourage investors from channelling funds towards green research and development. Patents can mitigate such financing constraints by sending important signals when the prospects of young companies are being assessed.[31]To improve its role in cleantech innovation, it is essential for Europe to reap the full benefits of the Single Market and tackle regulatory fragmentation.In this article we look at the green investment needs in the EU to 2030, how they are funded and policy options that would support the green transition.A key message is that the green investment needed in the EU in addition to what has already been spent is substantial, up to 3.7% of 2023 GDP annually. Moreover, banks – which play a key role in the financing of the euro area economy – have started to reflect climate risks in their lending. By contrast, green financing via financial markets − ranging from green bonds to venture capital − is growing but is still at a low level. The public sector can play an important role in crowding in private investment and mobilising more private funding for green investment. A significant green public funding gap is, however, expected to emerge as of 2027 following the expiry of the RRF. Furthermore, structural policies are essential to support green investment and innovation in green technologies, while a shortage of green skills and a high regulatory burden are seen as obstacles. Finally, it will be a challenge to fund the massive green investment needs, in part due to shortfalls that have already taken place and the expected green public funding gap after the RRF expires. Further progress towards more integrated European capital markets appears crucial to mobilise private funding sources beyond bank lending.Looking beyond the 2030 green transition horizon, available estimates point to even higher investment needs to reach the goal of carbon neutrality.[32]While associated with even greater uncertainty than the estimates presented here, estimates of investment needs beyond this decade suggest a need to further accelerate green investment activities at both the national and the EU level. Moreover, adaptation investment may turn out to be sizeable, in particular if the effects of climate change become more pervasive.',\n",
       "  'Prepared by Pablo Anaya Longaric, Alessandro De Sanctis, Charlotte Grynberg, Vasileios Kostakis and Francesca VinciPublished as part of theECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 8/2024.The surge in energy prices following the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine exposed the EU to the largest energy shock since the 1970s.As a key input in virtually any production process, the sharp rise in energy prices not only contributed to a surge in inflation and a loss of purchasing power for households but also to a significant increase in input costs, with ripple effects across all economic sectors.Shocks that increase the cost of energy can negatively influence economic dynamics not only in the short run but also in the medium to long run through the investment channel.In the short term, higher input costs put downward pressure on production.[1]This can also result in lower investment, with negative consequences for productivity growth in the long term.[2]The economic literature has long identified the importance of investment for productivity.Corporate investment, especially in fixed capital and research and development (R&D), is at the heart of productivity growth, which is in turn directly linked to the ability of firms to compete in international markets.[3]Productivity improvements reduce the cost of production per unit of output, allowing firms to lower prices and/or increase profit margins. Productivity increases can also enhance export competitiveness, as more productive firms are better positioned to capture and expand their market share.[4]Energy shocks can also dampen a country’s competitiveness through their negative impact on investment and productivity.Following a positive shock to energy costs, compressed profit margins (especially for energy-intensive firms), subdued economic activity, heightened uncertainty and, in some cases, tighter financing conditions may reduce investment by firms, paving the way for future competitiveness losses.[5]This may occur particularly when producers are unable to fully pass on the cost increases to consumers, for instance due to a high price elasticity of demand.[6]However, energy shocks can also incentivise firms to invest in energy generation and energy-saving projects.[7]Recent surveys indicate that firms are adapting to the evolving energy landscape by reducing their dependence on traditional energy sources in order to shelter against future energy shocks and secure competitive advantages.[8]These efforts to reduce the energy bill can lead to an increase in green investment, which can mitigate the overall impact of energy shocks on total investment. However, despite their potential to mitigate future energy shocks (and to reduce future energy prices), green investments may also be adversely affected by the direct and indirect consequences of an increase in energy prices.[9]This article explores how energy shocks influence investment by European firms, focusing on fixed capital and R&D expenditure.Empirical analysis shows that energy shocks can have a negative impact on corporate investment and thus, potentially, undermine European productivity growth and future competitiveness. The analysis also shows that financially constrained firms and firms in energy-intensive sectors are more affected by energy shocks and respond by cutting investment more than other firms.From a policy perspective, both national and EU measures are needed to reduce the exposure of the EU to future energy shocks.Further integration of European energy markets and progress in the green transition would contribute to reducing energy prices and strengthening energy supply, making the EU less vulnerable to adverse energy price developments.The main energy sources used in production in the EU are electricity and natural gas, together with oil and petroleum products.Electricity and natural gas are key inputs, each making up around a third of the EU’s industrial energy mix. These are followed by “oil and petroleum products” and “renewables and biofuels” at 11% each (Chart 1, panel a).[10]The industrial energy mix has remained largely unchanged over the past 15 years. When considering the energy landscape in which industry operates, it is also relevant to consider how the consumed electricity is generated, as this has a significant impact on its price. While the share of renewables in the EU electricity generation mix is growing, natural gas and other fossil fuels still play an important role (Chart 1, panel b), indirectly increasing their importance in the energy supply of firms.Due to the marginal pricing system, the price of electricity is closely linked to fossil fuels.Electricity prices in short-term markets are determined by the most expensive facility used to generate electricity at any given point in time. In the EU, gas-fired power plants are typically the most expensive way of generating electricity, followed by coal, lignite and nuclear power. Renewables are typically the cheapest, as their variable costs are close to zero. A consequence of this mechanism is that gas often acts as the price-setter even though it generates a relatively low share of the EU’s electricity. According to the European Commission, in 2022 gas-fired power plants generated 19% of the EU’s electricity but set the price 55% of the time.[11]Wholesale energy prices in the EU began rising significantly in the second half of 2021.As the EU imports nearly all the oil and gas it consumes, it is strongly exposed to price fluctuations in global markets, which can be affected by geopolitical developments and production decisions outside of the EU. Wholesale oil and gas prices started to go up in the second half of 2021, in part because of the recovery in economic activity following the pandemic and in part due to constraints in the supply of oil and gas. This was exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which drove up gas and oil prices further.[12]High gas prices had, in turn, a knock-on effect on electricity prices due to the marginal pricing system.The spike in wholesale prices had a strong impact on the price of energy for EU industry.Wholesale prices are not transmitted perfectly to retail prices, as the latter are also influenced by factors such as taxation, regulatory frameworks, infrastructure availability, the electricity generation mix and contract structures. From 2021 onwards, many public policy measures were also taken to cushion energy shocks. Nevertheless, Chart 2 shows that the increase in wholesale prices was strongly transmitted to the retail prices paid by EU firms for electricity, natural gas and diesel. This had a significant impact on their production costs, with the producer price index for energy (PPI energy) more than doubling between 2020 and 2022.These developments spurred an intense policy debate about the EU’s dependence on imported energy and on the implications for its competitiveness in the face of energy shocks.[13]The EU relies significantly on imported energy and is thus more exposed to energy shocks than other major economies, such as the United States.[14]While quantifying the effects of energy shocks on investment decisions is challenging, owing to the multitude of transmission channels as well as data limitations, exploring historical patterns can provide useful insights.To pin down the effect of energy shocks on investment, this article employs balance sheet data on publicly listed firms from Standard & Poor’s Compustat for the period 1999-2022 and estimates the response of fixed capital and R&D investment using local projections.[15]Energy shocks can originate from different energy sources, and correctly identifying them is a major challenge.The energy crisis of 2022 was triggered by the disruption of natural gas supplies in Europe, which led to an increase in fossil fuel and electricity prices. However, given the historical importance of oil shocks, these have attracted more attention from academic literature than gas shocks, resulting in only a few reliable and readily available measures for the latter.[16]Furthermore, oil accounts for a significant share of energy consumed by the EU industrial sector, and prices of other energy sources, such as gas, are influenced by oil prices. Oil shocks can therefore be a good proxy for energy shocks, albeit with some caveats.[17]One of the most recent methods for identifying and measuring oil shocks concerns oil supply news shocks.[18]These shocks capture shifts in expectations about future oil production and prices rather than immediate disruptions, making them particularly relevant for investment decisions.[19]Oil supply news shocks increase energy prices and reduce aggregate investment.As shown in Chart 3, an oil supply news shock leads to a contemporaneous increase of 7% in oil prices and of 1% in PPI energy.[20]Moreover, total gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) declines immediately after the shock, reaching a trough of -1.5% after two years. Investment in intellectual property products (IPP), which includes R&D, also decreases by 1% two years after the shock.[21]Consistent with the aggregate evidence, firm-level analysis based on publicly listed firms shows that oil supply news shocks exert downward pressure on investment.[22]As shown in panel a) of Chart 4, following an oil supply news shock that increases PPI energy by 1%, capital expenditure of publicly listed firms decreases by 2.9% on impact and 4.1% after one year.[23]R&D expenditure displays a smaller decline of around 0.85% both on impact and one year after the oil shock (Chart 4, panel b). Compared to the aggregate analysis, firm-level results show a larger impact of the shocks on capital expenditure and a similar impact on R&D expenditure. A possible explanation for this discrepancy lies in the sample coverage. In the Compustat sample analysed, R&D expenditure accounts for approximately 60% of aggregate R&D spending on average during the sample period. In contrast, the sample coverage for capital expenditure is only around 20%. This suggests that the firm-level R&D response is likely to be more aligned with the aggregate results than the capital expenditure response. However, the exact nature of the difference in terms of capital expenditure is not known beforehand, meaning that the response could be either larger or smaller than the aggregate result. Examining the sectoral coverage reveals that energy-intensive firms are represented more in the firm-level sample than in the aggregated data. Specifically, the capital expenditure of energy-intensive firms makes up about 40% of total capital expenditure in the Compustat sample, whereas it only accounts for 12% in the aggregate data.[24]To the extent that energy-intensive firms are more susceptible to energy shocks and hence reduce investment more than non-energy-intensive firms, the firm-level results are consistent with the aggregate findings. This is discussed in more detail in the next paragraph.The role played by energy intensity warrants consideration because energy-intensive industries (EIIs) are particularly vulnerable to energy shocks owing to their energy needs.EIIs include sectors such as chemicals, metals, cement and glass and account for about 45% of electricity, gas and oil used by EU industries, despite representing less than 4% of EU gross value added in 2021.[25]These provide key materials for industries such as construction, the automotive industry and electronics and are important suppliers to sectors driving the green and digital transitions.[26]As a result, these are pivotal both to the EU’s decarbonisation goals and to its open strategic autonomy. However, European EIIs are burdened with electricity prices that are significantly higher than in some other economies, such as the United States, resulting in a competitive disadvantage.[27]Financial constraints also play an important role in the investment decisions of firms.Financing conditions have long been recognised in the academic literature as critical enablers of investment, significantly influencing firms’ capacity to respond to shocks.[28]Survey evidence further indicates that financial constraints frequently emerge as major barriers to investment, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty.[29]Measuring financing constraints is challenging, as there is no agreed definition, but balance sheet data can be used to construct relevant estimates. The literature indicates that firms with relatively high debt (defined as a leverage ratio higher than the sample median) that are also of young age can be considered financially constrained.[30]High leverage constrains financing because firms with significant debt can be considered riskier, which leads to higher borrowing costs and stricter financing terms, while being a young firm compounds this constraint, as younger firms may lack established credit histories, collateral and proven revenue streams, making lenders more cautious when lending to them and thus limiting the availability of affordable external financing.The joint occurrence of high energy intensity and financing constraints can amplify the effects of energy shocks.Recent survey data suggest that firms that self-identify as financially constrained are more likely to consider increases in energy costs as an impediment to investment than their non-financially constrained counterparts.[31]Empirical analysis reveals that financially constrained firms in energy-intensive sectors consistently reduce investment more sharply than other firms after an oil shock. Chart 5 shows the effect on firms, grouped according to energy intensity and financial constraints, of an oil supply news shock that raises PPI energy by 1% on impact. The analysis reveals that all groups reduce investment, but being in an energy-intensive sector and being financially constrained amplifies the impact of the shock on both capital and R&D expenditure.[32]The evidence presented in this article suggests that energy shocks tend to decrease investment and innovation in Europe, especially for financially constrained firms in energy-intensive sectors.Publicly listed firms in the EU reduce investment in response to energy shocks (as proxied by oil shocks). Empirical analysis indicates that a 1% increase in energy prices driven by oil shocks leads to a significant decrease in fixed capital expenditure (-4.1% after one year), while R&D spending drops by almost 1%, showing a more muted impact. Moreover, firms that are financially constrained and energy-intensive experience sharper reductions in investment following an oil price increase.These findings are in line with a broad body of literature documenting the negative macroeconomic effects of oil shocks and confirm the importance of reducing the EU’s vulnerability to such shocks.The EU is heavily reliant on imported energy, making it more exposed to energy shocks than other major economies. As energy shocks put downward pressure on investment, and to the extent that investment slowdowns can lead to a decline in productivity, the EU is at risk of gradually losing competitiveness. This may threaten not only current but also future prosperity.[33]Policy measures at both national and European level should therefore aim to secure the energy supply of the EU, lower energy prices and mitigate the exposure of firms to future energy shocks.While national interventions are best suited to address country-specific issues, EU actions should be aimed at tackling shared problems and fostering cross-country collaboration. The Draghi and Letta reports contain several proposals to address these issues.[34]These include strengthening joint procurement of gas imports to increase the EU’s market power and expanding the use of long-term electricity contracts. The two reports also emphasise that accelerating and simplifying permitting processes, channelling EU funds, and promoting cross-border projects to boost renewable energy production would enhance energy security and reduce energy prices in the medium term. Moreover, the Draghi report suggests targeted support measures for EIIs to ensure they remain competitive while contributing to decarbonisation. Finally, advancing the capital markets union could help ease financing constraints for firms, enabling them to invest in improving their energy efficiency. Together, these measures would have the potential to strengthen the resilience of the EU to future shocks and increase its long-term competitiveness.',\n",
       "  'Prepared by Krzysztof Bańkowski, Nicholai Benalal, Othman Bouabdallah, Roberta De Stefani, Christian Huber, Pascal Jacquinot, Carolin Nerlich, Marta Rodríguez-Vives, Bela Szörfi, Nico Zorell and Christoph ZwickPublished as part of theECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 8/2024.Four years into the implementation of the Next Generation EU programme (NGEU), this article provides an updated assessment of its economic effects.To support Europe’s economic recovery from the pandemic and to make its economies more competitive and resilient, with a focus on digital and green transformation, in July 2020 European Union Member States agreed to launch the EU’s largest ever funding programme, NGEU. To achieve these objectives, the programme offers financial support to EU Member States on the condition that they implement specified investment and reform projects over the period 2021-2026. Earlier ECB staff analysis concluded that NGEU had the potential to deliver these objectives, provided that the planned investments and reforms were implemented in good time and effectively.[1]Now, more than halfway into the implementation period of NGEU, this article provides a description of the situation to date, as well as an updated assessment of the economic impact of the programme. It focuses on the impact of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) – the centrepiece of NGEU – on the euro area economy. Among euro area countries, particular attention is paid to Italy and Spain as the main recipients of RRF funds in absolute terms.The original budget set aside to fund NGEU was more than €800 billion for the whole EU.Among the several programmes initiated under NGEU, the RRF was by far the largest, accounting for almost €724 billion, around 90% of the total envelope. Under the RRF, funding was made available to EU Member States in the form of grants (up to €338 billion) and loans (up to nearly €386 billion).EU Member Stateshave since applied for €650 billion in RRF funds.While all of them requested the RRF grants in full, several chose not to apply for RRF loans, or requested less than they were entitled to ask for by the deadline of August 2023. Moreover, the envelope itself was subsequently revised.[2]As a result of updated national recovery and resilience plans (RRPs) and the updated total envelope, EU countries had applied for €650 billion in RRF funds as at 26\\xa0August 2024. This equals 4.6% of 2019 EU gross domestic product (GDP). Additionally, Member States are entitled to €83\\xa0billion (0.6% of 2019 EU GDP) in funds from other programmes under NGEU. It should be pointed out that although the size of NGEU disbursements to Member States has increased significantly, this is in part offset by an erosion caused by the unanticipated inflationary shock which occurred after the inception of the programme. In the case of investment financing grants, which are the most relevant in terms of the stimulative macro effect, the nominal increase (around 10% to euro area countries) means that the real value is broadly maintained.Focusing on the euro area, member countries are entitled to use RRF funds of up to €532 billion, that is, 82% of the EU total of €650 billion.Out of this amount, it is estimated that a little less – €486 billion – will actually be spent.[3]It is on the basis of this latter figure – almost half a trillion euro in RRF-funded public expenditure – that this article builds estimates of the macroeconomic impact of the RRF on the euro area via the fiscal channel.In order to disburse these funds to EU Member States, at the time of drafting this article the Commission had already borrowed more than €320 billion.Out of this amount, €265.4 billion were paid to the Member States after their satisfactory fulfilment of the qualitative milestones and quantitative targets related to the completion of the reforms and investments associated with each tranche of the RRF. This means that, at that time, around 60% of RRF grants and loans still had to be paid to the EU Member States (50% for euro area countries).The implementation of the RRF allowed for joint borrowing and risk sharing among Member States.This is particularly the case for the grant component. As the grants are intended to be repaid through the EU budget, these do not add to the national debt. However, this does not mean it is a cost-free measure for Member States as a group. While repayment risks are minimal owing to the budgetary safeguards in place, the burden of repayment will ultimately fall almost entirely on Member States. The incidence and distribution of this burden across countries remains uncertain.NGEU borrowing and repaymentWith the implementation of NGEU, the volume of the European Commission’s issuance to international capital markets markedly increased.While the Commission’s issuance on behalf of the European Union to finance EU policy programmes had previously been limited, between January 2020 and May 2024 its net issuance reached almost €500 billion, primarily for NGEU. This surpassed issuances by other EU entities, including the European Stability Mechanism and the European Investment Bank. This large-scale borrowing will continue until the end of 2026 at the latest, with an approximate estimate of €150 billion in issuances per year. In accordance with the Own Resources Decision[4], after 2026 the Commission will not be able to conduct new net borrowing. However, it does have the leeway to shift to regular liquidity management operations and debt roll-over, aiming to smooth the schedule for repayment of EU borrowing allocated to NGEU until 31 December 2058 at the latest.The loans will be repaid by the borrowing Member States and the grant component of NGEU will be financed through the EU budget, with budgetary safeguards in place to mitigate risks on future repayments.In particular, the Member States have committed to ensuring that the budget of the Commission will have enough funds to repay the grants. The refinancing is guaranteed by the temporary “budgetary headroom”, that is, the commitment by Member States of up to 0.6% of gross national income (GNI) designed to ensure that the EU can meet its commitments towards investors. In addition, the Commission has proposed to raise an additional 0.2% of GNI through a mix of traditional EU revenues and additional transfers. However, it is still uncertain whether the Council of the European Union will approve the proposal.While we do not foresee material repayment risk arising from NGEU borrowing, the financial burden will ultimately fall on EU Member States, which should account for it in their medium-term plans.Assuming that the Commission will use the available leeway to ensure a steady and predictable reduction of liabilities, we estimate that the annual repayment cost of the grant component of the RRF will peak at €26 billion in 2028 and steadily fall thereafter. Repayments remain well below the temporary budgetary headroom and could be fully covered through either new EU own resources or higher GNI-based contributions, both of which are sufficient in size. Regardless of the agreement on the Commission’s proposal, repayment will largely rely on national transfers to the EU budget, potentially leading to higher taxes or constraints on investments. Nevertheless, there are country-specific risks, with each option having diverse distributional effects.RRF payments to Member StatesBy August 2024, RRF payments of over €238 billion had been made, €156 billion of which were in the form of grants.These payments to Member States followed 45 finalised payment requests to the Commission. In addition, eight further requests had been submitted but not yet finalised at that point in time (Table 1 shows evidence for the euro area, non-euro area and the whole EU).RRF-funded expenditure in the euro areaThe composition of RRF expenditure across euro area countries varies greatly both in terms of the share of national GDP and the share of total euro area GDP (Chart 1).Some differences can also be observed in terms of distribution of the spending categories within countries, although government capital spending – the sum of government investment and government capital transfers – accounts for the bulk of expenditure in nearly all countries.A large part of the RRF expenditure aims to support the green and digital transitions.In line with the NGEU legislation, countries need to commit at least 37% of expenditure under the RRF to green projects and 20% to digital projects. Yet the actual amounts of RRF funds that euro area countries have committed to spending on those two objectives by end-2026 significantly exceed these targets. According to the Commission, the commitments reach on average 42% (green spending) and 27% (digital spending) of total RRF funds. Contributions of national plans to the climate and digital objectives are heterogenous across euro area countries.On average, fiscal experts within the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) estimate that around 80% of RRF-based expenditure in the euro area is additive in nature.In other words, this share of expenditure provides a genuine fiscal stimulus rather than a substitute for already planned expenditure. This is the basis for the macroeconomic estimates in this article.RRF expenditure is heavily backloaded to the second half of the programme, with clear implications for the assessment of macroeconomic impact.In each of the years between 2021 and 2023, there was significant under-execution of RRF-funded expenditure in most euro area countries when compared with their original plans (Chart 2). The pattern is observed for both relatively high and low funding recipients. This is mainly because of (i) limits to the administrative capacity to spend; and (ii) a sequence of shocks which resulted in supply-side bottlenecks and downscaling of procurement contracts because of higher-than-expected inflation.As a result, ECB staff estimate that in 2021-2023 the RRF increased the level of euro area GDP by 0.1 to 0.2% only (see Section 3). This is much lower than the previously estimated effect of around 0.5%, which assumed swift and full implementation of the original plans in the absence of the inflation surge.Structural reforms are an essential part of RRPs and complement RRF-linked investments.[5]The planned reforms aim to modernise the euro area economies and increase their resilience over the medium term. To this end, the RRF regulation requires that the reforms be tailored to Member States’ structural weaknesses, commensurate with the size of the individual RRF envelopes and complementary to RRF-financed public expenditure. The reforms also support institutional and economic convergence across euro area countries, since the initial framework conditions in the countries with the most comprehensive RRF-linked reform plans were generally weaker than in many peer countries. Recent RRP modifications have left the overall balance of reforms and investments broadly unchanged compared with the initial plans (with reforms accounting for 40% of all milestones and targets), but planned reforms have become “greener” and less frontloaded overall.Although the implementation of RRF-linked structural reforms has progressed, significant delays in RRP implementation have materialised.By early September 2024 euro area countries had fulfilled around 40% of all milestones and targets in relation to structural reforms, according to the European Commission’s assessment. Even so, only around one third of all envisaged payment requests had been submitted by that time. This falls short of the indicative timetable included in the RRPs, according to which around one half of all planned payment requests should have been submitted by then (Chart 3). Euro area countries featuring a combination of relatively weak administrative capacity and a large RRF allocation have recorded the longest RRP implementation delays overall.Many euro area countries still need to fulfil most or even all of their RRF-linked reform commitments.Although the RRF has already entered the second half of its envisaged lifespan, the share of reform-related milestones and targets already assessed and deemed to have been fulfilled by the Commission is well below 50% in many euro area countries (Chart 4). All milestones and targets will need to be completed by 31\\xa0August 2026 at the latest according to the RRF regulation. Only a few countries have already been assessed and deemed by the Commission to have implemented more than 50% of their reform-related milestones and targets.In view of these challenges, there is a risk that the effectiveness of RRFs will be diminished by incomplete or ineffective implementation.Incomplete implementation could arise if Member States were to implement only a subset of the agreed policy measures by August 2026. The 2024 country-specific recommendations issued under the European Semester therefore call on many Member States to accelerate the implementation of their RRPs. However, speeding up implementation of the plans is not sufficient for the RRF to achieve its full potential. Member States will need to ensure that speed does not come at the expense of the quality of measures implemented. If a trade-off between speed and quality were to emerge, prioritising quality over speed would help ensure the effectiveness of the reforms.By taking targeted policy action, euro area countries can ensure that NGEU-linked investments and reforms are implemented more effectively.Member States could redirect administrative resources towards implementing their RRPs and make more intensive use of available technical support at EU level. In addition, they could take advantage of the streamlining options offered by the European Commission’s updated RRP guidance, which include simplified reporting requirements and synergies between different audit procedures.[6]Member States could also seek to identify targeted regulatory changes outside the RRF framework; this would facilitate the roll-out of the RRPs without overly absorbing administrative resources.[7]Overall, such corrective policy measures would help improve reform implementation under the RRPs and might even alleviate any emerging trade-off between the speed and quality of RRP implementation.Assessing how NGEU affects the euro area economy involves examining multiple transmission channels.Building on previous analyses, we will consider three primary channels: (i) the risk premium channel; (ii) the fiscal channel; and (iii) the structural reform channel. Given significant implementation delays, the fiscal and structural reform channels warrant re-evaluation.The risk-premia effects that followed the announcement of NGEU continue to benefit recipient countries.The period following the Franco-German recovery fund proposal was marked by notable spread compression among beneficiaries. Bańkowski et al. (2022) concluded that a sustained reduction in risk premia could permanently increase euro area output by up to 0.2%, with Italy and Spain experiencing the most substantial benefits. We have refrained from updating this evaluation, as no significant developments warranting reassessment have occurred since then.The fiscal channel operates through increased public expenditure, primarily directed toward capital expenditure through government investment and capital transfers.For analytical purposes, both categories are treated as government investment, as NGEU-induced capital transfers are typically dedicated to private entities, such as railway companies, that are executing projects similar to public investment. The economic impact manifests through short-term demand stimulus during execution and long-term productive capacity enhancement through capital stock increases.[8]The structural reform channel, crucial for long-term economic potential, needs to be reassessed owing to implementation delays.These reforms boost potential output by improving the efficiency of resource utilisation. As the reforms extend beyond cyclical factors, they are not expected to have a direct impact on inflation – as a result, this study focuses primarily on output effects. However, the uncertainty inherent in quantifying structural reforms warrants caution when interpreting estimates.The analysis of the economic impact of NGEU makes use of two large-scale macroeconomic models: the ESCB’s public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) tool and input from a Eurosystem expert group.Applying multiple approaches in this study allows us to tailor methodologies to address the key questions. The use of two different types of macroeconomic model also makes the results more robust and enables us to highlight the specific channels driving particular economic outcomes.The macroeconomic effects of the fiscal channel are assessed using the EAGLE and the ECB-MC model.EAGLE (euro area and global economy) is a global dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with forward-looking expectations, while the ECB-MC (multi-country) model is a semi-structural model of the five largest euro area countries which balances empirical fit with theoretical foundations.[9]Both models demonstrate fiscal multipliers for government investment of approximately unity, aligning with literature that identifies public investment as a potent fiscal instrument owing to its direct impact on GDP and enhancement of productive capital. However, the models exhibit important differences in their expectation mechanisms: EAGLE’s forward-looking approach enables prominent anticipation effects, while ECB-MC’s backward-looking expectations largely preclude such effects, leading to distinct simulated outcomes, especially when it comes to price dynamics.The analysis is complemented by two additional tools which shed light on potential output and debt-to-GDP ratio effects.A Eurosystem expert group made up of staff from seven euro area central banks has provided an assessment of NGEU’s impact on euro area potential output, considering both reforms and investments across all NGEU instruments. Furthermore, the DSA tool estimates NGEU’s impact on government debt-to-GDP ratios through a detailed decomposition of debt dynamics.[10]The quantification of the fiscal impact of RRF-funded expenditures relies on data collected by ESCB experts.The data captures essential programme characteristics, including composition, implementation timeline and the distinction between additive and substitutive projects. Differentiation along the last dimension is crucial for identifying projects that would have occurred independently of the programme, thus preventing overestimation of macroeconomic effects.The quantification is based on scenario analysis across two key dimensions: fund absorption rates and public capital productivity.For absorption, we consider both full absorption by 2026 and an alternative scenario maintaining the observed 50% absorption rate, reflecting implementation challenges (Chart 5, panels a) and b). Regarding productivity, the baseline assumes a Cobb-Douglas production function parameter of 0.1 for public capital in EAGLE, with alternative scenarios of 0.05 and 0.15, while ECB-MC treats public and private capital as equally productive.[11]In practical terms, these different productivity parameters determine how effectively public capital translates into economic output: a higher parameter of 0.15 generates stronger economic benefits, while a lower value of 0.05 implies more modest returns from public spending.Our study finds that the NGEU programme could deliver substantial macroeconomic benefits for the euro area through various transmission channels.This section distinguishes between the impact on output and inflation via the fiscal channel, potential output gains from structural reforms and implications for the debt-to-GDP ratio.The impact of the programme on the level of GDP is estimated to range between 0.4% and 0.9% above the non-programme baseline by 2026, with gains increasing to 0.8-1.2% up to 2031 (Table 2).This trajectory reflects two main drivers: initial gains due to the fiscal stimulus, followed by growth-enhancing effects created by structural reforms. The increase in benefits over time primarily stems from the growing returns of structural reforms, even as NGEU spending effects diminish. However, structural reform channel effects carry greater uncertainty than fiscal channel impacts. The output estimates exclude both the already-realised confidence effects stemming from the programme’s announcement and the minimal expected impact of private sector financing facilitation.Impact of the fiscal channel on GDP and inflationOur macroeconomic simulations indicate that NGEU-induced fiscal stimulus can generate significant gains for euro area output (Table 3). These gains are projected to range between 0.3% and 0.8% by 2026, the final implementation year, with persistent effects of 0.2% to 0.6% by 2031. This lasting impact reflects the durable nature of NGEU investment projects, which primarily target government investment and contribute to long-term productive capacity. Effects are particularly pronounced in the main beneficiary countries, including Italy and Spain, where gains are two to three times higher than for the euro area average.The assumptions regarding both RRF fund absorption and productivity are important, with absorption being particularly decisive.In the low-absorption scenario, where implementation maintains the slow pace observed in the past, output gains halve compared with the full absorption scenario, both assuming medium productivity (Table 3, bottom row). Productivity assumptions also significantly influence final outcomes, with low and high productivity scenarios showing notable differences from the central case (Table 3, top rows). Governments aiming to maximise the programme’s impact should prioritise efficient projects offering the highest economic returns.The output gains from NGEU are still largely to materialise, contingent on implementation catch-up.The programme has experienced significant backloading compared with the previous assessment, resulting in modest output benefits thus far. However, substantial resources should be deployed in the coming years. Assuming high absorption of the remaining funds, the catch-up in implementation should result in output gains that nearly double those observed to date (Chart 6).Regarding inflation, the analysis identifies a modest impact on the euro area (Chart 7).Our simulations suggest a peak difference of around 0.1 percentage points compared with the non-programme baseline. In the main beneficiary countries – Italy and Spain – effects could temporarily reach 0.3 percentage points. Inflation dynamics are largely model-dependent: forward-looking models like EAGLE show rapid demand-driven inflation offset by anticipated productivity increases, while backward-looking models like ECB-MC capture gradual price adjustments to demand pressures.The current assessment reflects significant time reprofiling compared with a previous evaluation.The 2021 assessment assumed ambitious and rapid implementation from the outset, with early output gains.[12]However, implementation delays have pushed execution into the second half of NGEU’s lifespan, shifting the timing of the programme’s impact. Despite these delays, the magnitude of the overall effect remains broadly in line with initial estimates.Impact of structural reforms on potential outputUpdated estimates by an ESCB expert team suggest that NGEU could raise the level of euro area potential output by 1.0% by 2031 and 1.3% by 2033 if the RRPs are fully implemented.These estimates encompass the impact of both fiscal expenditure and structural reforms. The estimates are not identical to those presented for the fiscal channel in the previous section, since they are based on a different methodology and look at potential as opposed to actual output.[13]Potential growth could be boosted by 0.10-0.15 percentage points per annum over 2020-2033 (Chart 8). Until around 2027 a significant part of the impact is expected to arrive via the capital contribution, representing the impact of investments. Afterwards, the largest part of the impact is expected to operate via structural reforms, mostly affecting the contribution of total factor productivity to potential growth, and to some extent the labour contribution. These estimates cover the impacts of both reforms and investment.[14]Moreover, the estimates include the RRF as well as the other NGEU instruments.The updated estimates indicate a smaller impact of NGEU on potential output over the period 2020 to 2030 than estimated in 2022.[15]The ex-ante exercise expected a 0.5% impact on the level of euro area potential output by 2024. In the updated exercise, the estimated impact in 2024 is only 0.2% and the long-term impact of 1.3% is expected to materialise in 2033 instead of 2030 (Chart 9, panel a). The delay is also visible in the expected impact on potential growth: in 2022-2023, the growth impact is estimated to have been around half of what was originally foreseen. A lower growth impact is also expected over the long term, that is, 2025-2030 (Chart 9, panel b). The smaller expected impact on potential growth also reflects the fact that the previously anticipated effects of investments hardly materialised in 2022-2023, with 2024 being a transition year. From 2025 onwards, a pick-up in the impact on potential growth is expected as structural reforms start having an effect on potential growth. In the most recent update, however, this impact is also estimated to be slower. Overall, the lower and delayed impact stemming from investments and the lower impact coming from structural reforms leads to a smaller impact on the near-term potential growth profile than in the initial estimates.The revisions to the potential output estimates mainly reflect a backloading of previously expected effects on account of observed implementation delays.In fact, the long-term estimates regarding potential output growth converge to a similar level in both estimation vintages.[16]The differences between the two vintages mainly lie in the time profile over the short to medium term. This reflects the assumption of the ESCB expert group that the RRPs will eventually be fully implemented, despite the delays observed in the first half of NGEU’s envisaged lifespan. Notwithstanding this, the downside risks surrounding the potential output baseline estimates have increased since 2022 owing to the observed implementation delays.Impact on public debt and quality of public financeThe impact of the RRF on government debt-to-GDP ratios is estimated to be favourable and significant for the main beneficiary countries, as well as for the euro area as whole.For the debt impact, the analysis starts from the June 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections under the assumption that all currently expected RRF effects are at play, including a GNI-based repayment as of 2028 (see Section \\u200e2.1).[17]A counterfactual scenario without the RRF is built by subtracting all the RRF’s debt-reducing and debt-increasing effects. For Italy and Spain, the overall debt-reducing impact of the RRF is estimated to be around 7-8 percentage points in the central scenario assuming middle productivity (Chart 10). The overall impact on debt does not change significantly when applying high or low productivity assumptions. Turning to the whole euro area, the impact of the RRF on its debt ratio is also estimated to be favourable.[18]The effects of the RRF on government debt ratios operate via four main channels, as illustrated in Chart 11:Although the favourable effects on the debt-to-GDP ratios of the main beneficiaries remain significant, this update points to a significant downward revision compared with initial ECB staff estimates.For Italy and Spain, the projected impact by 2031 has been revised down to 7-8 percentage points from 12-14, as per Bańkowski et al. (2022). This is mainly due to delays in implementation, which have reduced the impact on both budget outcomes and GDP. More crucially, these delays have led to a significant downward revision in potential GDP, affecting long-term debt projections.Lastly, the RRF implementation may also be driving some improvement in the quality of public finance at the national level.Preliminary evidence on the changes in the composition of public expenditure in the main beneficiary countries suggests that the implementation of the RRF has resulted in a shift towards items with stronger effects on GDP growth, such as renewable energy, charging stations for electric vehicles, the digitalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises and artificial intelligence.[20]NGEU is expected to have a positive impact on euro area output in the long run, while the impact on inflation is expected to be relatively muted.Model-based estimates suggest that public expenditure and structural reforms linked to NGEU have the potential to increase the level of euro area GDP by around 0.4 to0.9% by 2026 and 0.8 to 1.2% by 2031. The estimation ranges reflect the prevailing uncertainty around key assumptions, most notably whether the planned investments and reforms will be implemented completely and effectively. The favourable impacts of NGEU are projected to contribute to a decline in the government debt-to-GDP ratios of the main beneficiary countries. On the nominal side, NGEU is only likely to have a muted impact on euro area inflation owing to countervailing demand and supply effects.However, the expected positive impact on output is likely to materialise later than initially expected and subject to downside risks.Even the upper bound of the updated estimates of NGEU’s impact on the level of euro area output in 2031 is lower than what was envisaged in ECB staff estimates from early 2022. This downward revision largely reflects delays in the implementation of the national investment and reform plans. These delays, in turn, mainly reflect administrative constraints and the ramifications of the energy inflation shock following the Russian war on Ukraine. Despite the inflation surge, the programme’s real value has remained approximately stable through concurrent increases in RRF-related investment financing grants to euro area countries. Also, the projected long-run impact of NGEU on the growth rate of euro area output is largely in line with previous results. Therefore, the revisions to the output estimates overall constitute areprofilingrather than a reassessment of NGEU’s long-run effectiveness. Given the transmission lags involved, it is arguably too early to draw firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of NGEU-linked investments and reforms. Even so, the risk of ineffective or incomplete implementation of NGEU-linked investments and reforms has increased since 2022. The implementation delays observed so far, combined with the fixed end-date of NGEU, suggest that some projects could either be “rushed through” at the expense of implementation quality, or cancelled altogether.By taking targeted policy action, euro area countries can ensure that NGEU-linked investments and reforms are implemented more effectively.Most notably, Member States could redirect administrative resources, make more intensive use of available technical support at EU level and identify targeted regulatory changes that would facilitate the roll-out of their NGEU projects. Such corrective policy measures might alleviate any emerging trade-off between the speed and quality of plan execution in the second half of the NGEU’s envisaged lifespan, that is, until August 2026. More generally, such policy efforts are vital to ensuring that NGEU can unlock its transformative potential and act as a catalyst for the modernisation and strengthening of the euro area economies.',\n",
       "  \"Prepared by Marinela-Daniela Filip, Daphne Momferatou and Susana Parraga RodriguezPublished as part of theECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 1/2025.Competitiveness has returned to the top of the European agenda.Sustainable, long-term economic growth supports price stability and gives monetary policymakers more room for manoeuvre.[1]Long-standing challenges related to low productivity growth, burdensome regulations and demographic headwinds have been exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, trade fragmentation and the prospect of persistently high energy prices. Recent reports by Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta have highlighted these challenges and the need for urgent and concrete action that will enable Europe to catch up and maintain a competitive edge over its global competitors.[2],[3]The priority of the incoming European Commission is to speed up the rate of reform and investment, placing a particular focus on innovation, decarbonisation and strategic autonomy.[4]Competitiveness is a complex and multi-faceted concept that can be defined in various ways.Although there are multiple factors that interact with and influence competitiveness, the only sustainable long-term strategy to maintain a high level of competitiveness is robust productivity growth. This also boils down to ensuring that citizens enjoy a high standard of living. In light of current geopolitical tensions, competitiveness also needs to go hand-in-hand with resilience, i.e. the ability to withstand and adapt to shocks. By reducing those foreign strategic dependencies that create uncertainty and dampen investment, Europe can strengthen both its competitiveness and its economic security.This article focuses on the role institutions can play in boosting productivity growth through investment, innovation, and the green and digital transitions, thereby improving the competitiveness of the European economy.It follows on from previous Economic Bulletin articles that have focused on the external dimension and the potential implications energy shocks and corporate investment might have for European competitiveness.[5]Sustainable, long-term growth and economic competitiveness and resilience are underpinned by favourable institutional frameworks and complementary, high-quality physical infrastructures. Achieving sustainable economic growth and maintaining a competitive edge while advancing the green transition depends on key factors such as productivity growth, firm dynamism (generally the rate at which firms enter, grow and exit the market), investment, innovation and digital technology diffusion. The macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, including demographics and trade relations, also influences institutions and infrastructures and frames the broader policy options and priorities.The remainder of this article expands on the role key institutions play in ensuring competitiveness in the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.The next section briefly discusses measures of Europe’s productivity gap compared with other leading economies and links it to shortcomings in firm dynamism, investment, innovation and the diffusion of digital technology. Section 3 takes a detailed look at the role institutions play in supporting the broader framework in which European firms operate, grow and innovate, and highlights areas in need of reform. Box 1 provides a targeted examination of the complementary physical infrastructures and networks. Section 4 concludes by joining the call for urgent and concrete structural reform and policies to enhance Europe's competitiveness and resilience.Several studies show that low productivity growth in Europe is at the heart of the challenges it is facing in terms of competitiveness and that this is largely related to developments in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector.In the last few decades,productivity gains have gradually been slowing in many advanced economies.[6]Weaker productivity growth in Europe compared with the United States (US) stems mainly from the lower productivity and lower economic weighting of ICT-intensive industries. Chart 1, panel a, illustrates that after catching up with the United States until 1995, the euro area productivity gap started to widen. These productivity differences reflect both lower capital deepening and total factor productivity (TFP) contributions to growth in GDP per hour worked.[7]Insight into whether this can be explained by the ICT revolution having less of an effect in Europe than in the United States can be obtained by studying the differences at sectoral level. Gordon and Sayed analysed the developments in the United States and a set of EU countries using industry-level data.[8]For the period 1995-2005, they found that, in contrast to the United States, Europe experienced a slowdown in productivity growth due to several factors, including a scarcity of ICT investment, a failure to capture the efficiency benefits of ICT and performance shortfalls in specific industries including ICT production, finance and insurance, retail and wholesale, and agriculture.Firm dynamism is weaker in Europe than in the United States.While firm dynamism has suffered a secular decline in both Europe and the United States, the latter has seen the formation of relatively more new firms and a lower number of bankruptcy declarations in recent years.[9]In Europe, the average age of firms at the frontier, i.e. the most technologically advanced and productive firms within a particular industry, has increased substantially in recent decades. In the early 2000s frontier firms in manufacturing were on average 14 years old compared with over 20 years old today.[10]Labour productivity growth tends to decline as firms age, which may point towards a lack of competition and a low churn rate at the productivity frontier in Europe. Indeed, there appears to be a connection between the lack of competition from new, innovative firms and the survival of mature firms at the frontier.[11]Reducing financial constraints would support the development of innovative, young and small firms.Compared with their United States counterparts, Europe’s young, high-growth firms have a smaller economic footprint, with too few of them growing quickly and eventually making it to the top.[12]These firms often face more severe financial constraints than their established counterparts due to investor risk aversion, a lack of relationships of trust and a reliance on intangible assets, which are more difficult to collateralise.[13]Business dynamism has also been found to be lower in regions where the population is older (see also Section 3 below).[14]Overall, the result is a European corporate ecosystem of relatively small and ageing firms that are unable to compete globally.[15]Part of the solution lies in further integrating and developing capital markets in Europe, including risk capital markets such as venture capital, to complement the banking sector and enhance risk-taking capacity.[16]Increasing investment, particularly in intangibles such as research and development (R&D) and in the diffusion of digital technology, could improve Europe’s productivity.As shown in Chart 1, panel b, the euro area allocates a smaller proportion of its GDP to ICT equipment and intellectual property products than the United States, with the gap widening in recent years.[17]In addition, Europe focuses on marginal improvements in already mature technologies rather than in breakthrough innovation, meaning it is stuck in the “middle-technology trap”.[18]In terms of digital uptake, recent firm level analysis for the euro area shows that the adoption of digital technologies could lead to an increase in firms’ productivity in the medium term. But the effect of digital adoption is heterogenous across firms and sectors, and not all digital technologies deliver significant productivity gains. One way to increase the productivity benefits of digitalisation could be more efficient and effective institutions and governance structures, and complementary skills.[19]At the same time, enhancing European firms’ scaling up could advance their digitalisation.[20]Although the EU is lagging behind in R&D expenditure, its green innovation activity is still comparable to that of other major regions.In the EU, the expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP has been hovering around 2% in the last decade. This is much lower than in the United States and Japan, for example, and most recently was also below that of China (Chart 2, panel a), with most of the gap stemming from the private sector.[21]On the positive side, green innovation activity in the EU (in terms of international patent families) remains comparable for now with that of other countries, such as Japan and the United States. China, however, has been catching up at a fast pace and surpassed other major regions in 2021 (Chart 2, panel b).[22]If Europe wants to maintain its strong role in cleantech innovation, it will have to focus on patenting and scaling up, and to tackle regulatory fragmentation to ensure it reaps the full benefits of the Single Market.Institutions play a pivotal role in fostering a dynamic business environment, investment, innovation, and therefore productivity and competitiveness.Defined broadly, institutions encompass the formal and informal rules, norms and organisations that provide the structure for social, political and economic interactions. Research by the 2024 Nobel Laureates Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson emphasises the importance of inclusive institutions that provide broad access to economic opportunities and protect individuals against abuses of power.[23]In addition to ensuring the rule of law and reducing corruption, institutions that support human capital development, such as educational systems, are crucial for enhancing competitiveness. Well-functioning institutions in these areas also ensure a skilled workforce, which is indispensable for productivity growth and innovation.[24]Legal and regulatory frameworks significantly influence the business environment and firms’ investment decisions.Although most regulations are designed with the aim of protecting people’s health and the environment, they may have unintended economic and social consequences. Complex planning and approval procedures can be serious obstacles to investment, especially for small firms and in the context of the digital and green transitions. Regulations limiting the entry of firms into product and services markets, or constraining the use of certain technologies or data, can hinder the adoption of new technologies by increasing costs for new high-technology firms, therefore reducing competition and constraining technology spillovers.The complexity and variability of regulations across EU Member States create barriers to entry and increase compliance costs for businesses, making Europe less attractive compared with more streamlined regulatory environments like the United States.The European Investment Bank (EIB) Investment Survey has identified long-term barriers to firms’ investment decisions (Chart 3). More firms in Europe report major long-term barriers to investment than in the United States. While the availability of skilled staff is identified as the biggest barrier in both the EU and the United States, about twice as many firms in Europe report challenges such as higher energy costs, difficulties in accessing funding, and deficits in transport and digital infrastructure (see also Box 1). In a similar vein, more firms in the EU say that business and labour regulations are a major barrier to investment. While the difference does not seem to be very large, the EU average masks extensive heterogeneity across EU countries (see Chart 4, panel a). A similarly heterogeneous picture emerges regarding corporate restructuring processes, which need to be simplified, shortened and more harmonised. In 2019 the average time to resolve insolvency in the EU was double (around two years) that in the United States (Chart 4, panel b).The regulatory landscape in the United States is generally considered more business-friendly and focused on minimising bureaucratic hurdles to encourage innovation and investment.For example, the United States has a more flexible approach to environmental regulations and a less stringent data protection framework compared with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. This can make it easier for companies to operate and invest in new technologies and green initiatives. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 report, the average time to start a business in Europe varies considerably across countries and in many it is significantly longer than in the United States, highlighting the less efficient and fragmented regulatory processes in the EU.[25]The International Monetary Fund estimates that overall trade costs within Europe are equivalent to a sizeable ad valorem tariff of 44% for the average manufacturing sector compared with 15% between US states, and as high as 110% for services.[26]A large part of these high costs in Europe is related to regulatory entry barriers, which remain particularly high, especially for services.The recent reports by Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi also point to regulatory burden and fragmentation, which limit the ability of EU companies to scale up and compete internationally.Completing the Single Market and streamlining and harmonising business regulations where appropriate will be key to changing this. Examples include proposals to create a new business code as a 28thregime for European innovative companies (with a harmonised and limited set of regulations that would allow innovative firms to expand quickly across the entire EU), and steps towards harmonising national insolvency frameworks.[27]More expedient and harmonised procedures for cleantech applications could be another area to explore. A first step in this direction is the unitary patent system launched in 2023, which makes it possible to acquire patent protection in 17 EU Member States by submitting a single request to the European Patent Office.To address long-term barriers to investment related to access to financing, deeper capital markets and financial integration are essential.This could help create a unified and thus deep and liquid capital market, enabling firms to access a diverse range of funding sources, including venture capital. Increased access to risk capital could enable companies to boost investment in intangibles and R&D, including breakthrough innovations, while supporting financing for the green and digital transitions. A detailed discussion into these issues is beyond the scope of this article but is extensively covered in other ECB publications.[28]High-quality public institutions, as reflected in the efficient functioning of public administration, law enforcement and transparency, are prerequisites for the successful design and implementation of sound economic policies. One way to identify areas where improvements are needed most is to look at the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) data set. It summarises how companies, citizens and experts view the quality of governance. About half of EU countries have seen a deterioration in their composite ranking in the WGI over the last decade, and on average the current quality of EU institutions is below that of institutions in the United States and Japan (Chart 5).Administrative capacity is also part of governance and a particularly critical factor in facilitating investment during the green and digital transitions.The European Commission has recognised the importance of robust administrative frameworks in driving these transitions. The European Green Deal and the 2030 Digital Compass highlight the need for strong administrative systems to ensure that funds are allocated efficiently and that projects meet stringent environmental and technological standards.[29]The recent experience with the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) also highlighted the obstacles to the timely and effective absorption and use of funds related to administrative capacity bottlenecks, which was in part related to the RRF’s complex reporting and control system.[30]Well-developed administrative capacity can streamline the application, permit and screening processes, thus reducing the delays and uncertainties that often hinder investment.Educational systems play a key role in strengthening human capital and innovation.To enable technological change and innovation and to take advantage of the associated opportunities they offer, high-quality education systems alongside effective upskilling and reskilling programs are crucial. The latest results from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) underscore the need for Europe to continue improving its educational outcomes (Chart 6). According to the 2022 PISA results, several European countries, such as Estonia, Ireland and Finland, performed well on average in science, mathematics and reading. Compared with 2018, scores in most EU countries deteriorated significantly. This can only be partially attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, as scores were already falling pre-pandemic.[31]Significant disparities in educational performance remain in the EU, which continues to lag behind the United States and Japan.In addition to education systems, reskilling and upskilling are essential to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of the labour market driven by the digital and green transitions.The European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience emphasises the importance of lifelong learning and continuous skills development.[32]The Agenda aims to equip the workforce, including managers, with the skills needed to thrive in emerging industries and to support the EU’s goals in the digital and green transitions.[33]Europe needs to intensify its focus on education and skills development to catch up with the United States in technological innovation and diffusion. As mentioned at the beginning of Section 3, having skilled employees is also a major long-term barrier to business investment in Europe. The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) highlights the importance of skills intelligence and workforce planning. More integrated and forward-looking strategies in Europe to address skills shortages and mismatches are needed to achieve a more technologically advanced, greener and fairer future.[34]The importance of skills to address challenges on the competitiveness front is also highlighted in the Letta report, including the simplification of degrees and improved certification recognition across Europe.Negative demographic developments represent a challenge for Europe’s labour supply both in terms of quantity and skills.However, the relationship with productivity growth is less certain. In the years to come, older cohorts will make up an increasing part of the labour force. Their retirement will result in a reduced labour supply and shortages of certain skills, while there is no conclusive evidence of productivity gains from the younger cohorts being more formally educated.[35]Acemoglu and Restrepo[36]show that higher capital investments, such as greater adoption of robots and other automation technologies, could mitigate and even reverse the negative relationship between age and productivity. At the same time, older workers may be ill-equipped for a work environment which is rapidly adopting new technologies.Migrants are an important part of the European labour force and can help boost the labour supply and productivity, particularly against the backdrop of ageing populations.[37]Research shows that migration can have positive effects on productivity and long-term economic growth.[38]In recent years, amid high labour market tightness in Europe, migration has helped alleviate labour shortages and moderate wage growth, particularly in the hospitality, support services and construction sectors where entry barriers based on qualifications or language are lower.[39]Nonetheless, addressing the high degree of overqualification and skills mismatches experienced by migrants compared with permanent residents and nationals, could further help address labour and skills shortages and raise labour productivity gains.[40]The lower educational attainment levels of second-generation students in some countries also highlight problems related to the success of immigration or integration policies.Europe faces critical challenges in boosting productivity, investment and innovation, and therefore its competitiveness and resilience.Long-standing challenges related to low productivity growth, burdensome regulations and demographic headwinds have been compounded by geopolitical tensions, trade fragmentation and the prospects of persistently higher energy prices. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive structural reforms targeting higher regulatory efficiency, enhanced governance and administrative capacity, improved quality of education and skills’ matching, and modernised infrastructure. The population is shrinking, and our societies are ageing, so sustaining the workforce will rely on higher participation rates, especially among women and older people, alongside well-designed immigration policies to address labour shortages and support long-term growth.Mario Draghi’s proposals for enhancing European competitiveness and Enrico Letta’s proposals for empowering the Single Market highlight the need for coordinated action at the national level supported by more EU where it adds the most value.[48]National policies must prioritise increasing productivity growth through measures that support business dynamism, the adoption of technology, the financing of private investment and breakthrough innovations, and that address labour shortages and skill mismatches. At the EU level, the re-focusing of policy required could be facilitated by coordination based on agreed EU priorities. In addition, EU-level action is needed to provide essential public goods, including affordable and greener energy, breakthrough research and digital infrastructure for a wider diffusion of advanced technologies, especially artificial intelligence. “More Europe where it matters” also requires deepening the Single Market and strengthening cross-border, market-based risk sharing.This article joins the call for urgent and concrete structural reforms in Europe.The interplay between institutions, infrastructures and competitiveness underscores the need for transformative policy action. Addressing structural barriers, including inadequate physical and digital infrastructures and skill mismatches, while increasing access to finance, would enhance the potential for growth. Structural reforms would then also facilitate the smooth transmission of monetary policy to the whole euro area economy and thereby help preserve price stability in the euro area.[49]At the same time, such reforms and policies need to be shaped with a view to supporting the green and digital transitions and ensuring economic and social resilience to geopolitical tensions and possible future shocks. Crucially, improving the social acceptability of reforms and ensuring balanced regulation are key to their success.[50]Overall, policies need to be carefully designed, striking a balance between regulation and flexibility. This should ensure the protection of public interest without compromising on innovation and investment and therefore contribute towards sustainable improvements in European productivity and overall living standards.\",\n",
       "  'Prepared by Clémence Berson, Vasco Botelho, António Dias da Silva, Claudia Foroni, Matthias Mohr, Christofer Schroeder and Marco WeisslerPublished as part of theECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 8/2024.In the aftermath of the pandemic, the euro area labour market has shown remarkable resilience.The unemployment rate has remained at record lows and employment has grown steadily despite weak economic growth and various challenges to the economy, such as the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, geopolitical tensions and the subsequent monetary policy tightening. From the fourth quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2024, cumulative employment growth (3.3%) outpaced cumulative real GDP growth (2.4%) by 0.9 percentage points. This is remarkable given that both employment and output had fully recovered to their respective pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021. The resilience of employment has, however, led to a decline in labour productivity growth, measured in terms of average output per employee, which has dipped below its already weak historical trend.Higher profit margins and lower real wages, together with lower average hours worked per employee, have allowed firms to hire more workers and retain staff during weak economic growth, while increased labour force participation has helped address potential labour shortages.The surge in inflation at the onset of the energy crisis significantly reduced real wages, making hiring less costly for firms. This created incentives for them to favour labour input, given rising prices for energy and intermediate inputs, thereby contributing to resilient labour market dynamics during a period of weak economic growth.Additionally, substantially higher profit margins allowed firms to hire additional workers or maintain their current labour force. Faced with actual, or expected, labour shortages, firms chose to retain their workers, seeing labour hoarding as a less costly option than seeking replacement workers upon recovery from what was regarded as a temporary weak economic environment. Lower average hours worked per employee, amid still robust labour demand, encouraged companies to hire more workers to maintain their overall labour input. Recent survey evidence suggests that labour hoarding was one of the factors behind the decline in average hours worked per employee, with firms reducing working time in response to what they perceived as temporary lower demand.Moreover, sustained labour force growth in the post-pandemic period has incentivised firms to get new workers on board to address actual or expected labour shortages. The labour force participation rate has risen above pre-pandemic levels, driven primarily by transitions from inactivity to employment. Women, older workers, persons with a higher education and foreign workers have contributed the most to this increase. Faced with the possibility of labour shortages, firms hired these additionally available workers by way of precaution, despite subdued economic activity.This article closely examines each of these four factors, focusing on labour market dynamics in the euro area as a whole.The favourable aggregate dynamics reveal increasing heterogeneity across sectors, with low productivity sectors driving the aggregated data. While recognising the significant differences at the country level, analysing the euro area labour market at the aggregated level is key to a comprehensive understanding of the real economy and of the choices made by firms and workers that determine price and wage inflation. It also provides the ECB with important insight, which it needs to make effective policy decisions in line with its price stability mandate.The post-pandemic period was characterised by a remarkably robust labour market in the euro area.The recovery in economic activity following the pandemic was swift and accompanied by strong growth in employment. This stands in contrast to the periods following the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis, which saw slower employment growth despite a rebound in economic activity. By the end of 2021, the number of workers in job retention schemes – a feature of labour markets during the pandemic – came down significantly, pointing to the absence of hysteresis effects in the labour market and of any significant need for major job reallocation in the euro area.[1]Even the slowdown in economic activity following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting spike in energy prices, had no visible negative impact on the labour market.The euro area labour market’s performance has been exceptional as compared with changes in output (Chart 1, panel a).The relationship between employment and output growth, known as Okun’s law, suggests that employment and GDP developments were broadly aligned in 2022, while a gap emerged in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, the difference between actual employment and that suggested by GDP growth, rose to nearly 600 thousand workers, or around 0.35% of persons employed. The strong growth in employment in comparison with GDP was supported by firms retaining their workers, facilitated by rising corporate profits, declining real wages and lower average hours worked per person employed, as well as by robust growth in the labour force (Chart 1, panel b).[2]The fall in the average hours worked reflects the fact that the total hours worked has risen only modestly since late 2019 compared with the increase in the number of persons employed – a development which is discussed in detail in Section 5 of this article.Strong employment growth and weak GDP dynamics have led to a decline in productivity growth.The slowdown in productivity growth predates the pandemic but has gathered pace since 2022, under the combined effect of various adverse shocks to the euro area.[3]Quarter-on-quarter productivity growth turned negative in the fourth quarter of 2022 and has remained well below its pre-pandemic trend since then. On a cumulative basis, it has declined by 1.3% since the fourth quarter of 2021. Recently, however, there have been signs that the fall in labour productivity is slowing, given that quarter-on-quarter growth has been zero or slightly positive since the first quarter of 2024.The trends for aggregate employment and productivity mask heterogeneity across sectors.While employment growth was most prominent in the construction, public, and professional services sectors, it was weak in the manufacturing sector. Gross value added also developed differently across sectors, as did productivity. Strong growth in employment in the public and construction sectors between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2024 (8.9% and 7.1% respectively) outpaced that of gross value added (2.3% and 3.0% respectively), leading to a pronounced slowdown in productivity growth in these two sectors. By contrast, information and communication services saw a substantial increase in productivity growth, driven by robust growth in gross value added. For some sectors, changes in productivity growth evolved into two distinct phases: the acute pandemic period, from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2021, and the post-pandemic period after the first quarter of 2022. In the manufacturing sector, for example, cumulative growth in productivity per person and per hour stood at 8.6% and 7.8% respectively during the acute pandemic period. With the spike in energy prices in 2022, however, productivity growth turned negative and cumulative growth in productivity per person and per hour in the post-pandemic period fell to -2.4% and -2.9% respectively. Contact-intensive service sectors, such as the hospitality and food services industries, also saw growth in productivity of 1.6% per person and per hour during the acute pandemic period. While cumulative growth in productivity per person in these sectors remained positive during the post-pandemic period, rising to 1.6%, productivity growth per hour declined by 0.1%.The unemployment rate has remained at record lows.In September 2024 the unemployment rate in the euro area stood at 6.3% – the lowest ever to be recorded since the introduction of the euro and 1.1 percentage points below the pre-pandemic level observed in January 2020. The decline in the unemployment rate was broad-based across countries, with some variations. Spain and Italy, for example, experienced the largest reductions in unemployment rates over this period (-2.6 percentage points and -3.5 percentage points respectively), whereas Germany saw a slight rise (+0.3 percentage points). The fall at the euro area level was driven by a slight drop in the number of unemployed, of around 1.3 million persons, coupled with a significant increase in the labour force of 8.6 million compared with January 2020.Labour demand has remained robust overthe post-pandemic period, albeit it has started to ease more recently.The job vacancy rate spiked at 3.3% in the second quarter of 2022, pointing to a tight labour market, despite a deterioration in matching efficiency as regards job vacancies and job seekers. Since then, this rate has gradually declined, having fallen to 2.5% in the third quarter of 2024 – only 0.2 percentage points higher than its pre-pandemic level. Waning labour demand in recent quarters, coupled with a stable unemployment rate, has resulted in a vertical Beveridge curve and improved efficiency matching (Chart 2).Since the end of the pandemic, growth in employment has significantly exceeded that of economic activity.Historically, based on Okun’s law, employment growth typically expands at approximately half the rate of real GDP growth, with Okun’s elasticities estimated to range between 0.2 and 0.5. Employment growth has, however, surpassed GDP growth since 2022, with elasticities double the conventional estimates (Chart 3, panel a). This phenomenon mirrors the sluggish productivity trends observed within the euro area.The initial decrease in real wages at the onset of the energy crisis contributed to the disconnect between employment and output growth.The surge in inflation during the recent energy crisis led to a fall in real wages as nominal wages adjusted with a time lag. Initially, moreover, the decline in real wages outpaced the decline in productivity.[6]This gap between real wages and productivity has supported job creation by incentivising firms to hire, or retain, more workers given that labour input was perceived as being less expensive than other inputs (Chart 3, panel b).A key factor behind the decoupling of output and employment, leading to negative productivity growth, is the substitution of production factors.An analysis based on a structural Bayesian vector autoregressive model sheds light on the key factors underlying the decoupling of output and employment fluctuations, as well as the procyclicality of labour productivity. The model incorporates a factor substitution shock, capturing the direct substitution of labour with other production inputs, such as intermediate goods, energy and capital.[7]For periods in which there are energy crises and supply chain disruptions, this shock aims to capture the reallocation among inputs following a relative price shock, favouring the cheaper option. When real wages fall compared with other input prices, labour becomes more affordable than energy, capital and intermediate goods, naturally resulting in reallocation and substitution effects. The significance of the factor substitution shock is illustrated by the red bars in Chart 4, showing its substantial impact on productivity growth by driving output down and employment up. Consequently, the model attributes much of the recent productivity decline to cyclical factors. The resilience of the labour market, bolstered by the factor substitution shock, exacerbated this productivity drop. With the dissipation of the factors driving the factor substitution shock, such as the normalisation of energy and intermediate input prices, there has been a modest recovery in productivity.Additional drivers sustained employment dynamics amid economic stagnation.Recovering demand supported employment and output growth until early 2023. Since then, weakening demand has led to a sharper slowdown in economic activity compared with employment growth, exacerbating the deviations from Okun’s law (Chart 4, blue bars). A neutral technology shock (Chart 4, yellow bars), indicative of a decline in total factor productivity, exerted a largely negative impact on both output and employment growth, primarily on account of global supply bottlenecks, leaving productivity virtually unaffected. For 2022 the model attributes minimal negative effects to labour market-specific drivers (Chart 4, green bars), such as changes in labour force participation and increased worker bargaining power. These effects were partially reversed in 2023. The catch-up of real wages makes factor substitution less relevant and favours a realignment of employment and output dynamics, as well as a recovery in productivity.Rising profit margins enabled firms to retain their workers for longer than usual, despite falling revenues.[8]Recent ECB estimates show that higher profit margins have improved the ability of firms to hoard labour in the event of an adverse shock to their economic outlook.[9]The decision by firms to hoard labour is rational and consistent with long-term profit maximisation goals. Profit maximising firms choose to favour labour hoarding when the costs of redundancies, re-employment or training exceed the costs of worker retention. Increased labour hoarding occurs only when firms expect a temporary decline in demand for their goods or services. If a permanent fall in demand is anticipated, there is no incentive for firms to retain workers, given that their labour input would not be needed.The ECB labour hoarding indicator has remained above the historical average since the first quarter of 2022 but started to weaken in 2024, primarily on account of lower economic activity.[10]The proportion of euro area firms to hoard workers had been relatively flat, at around 12.2%, until the onset of the pandemic, when it sharply increased from 14.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 26.7% in the first quarter of 2020. The indicator has remained elevated since then, albeit showing some cyclical variations including a second sharp increase when energy prices surged. The labour hoarding indicator weakened during the first half of 2024, decreasing from 22% in the third quarter of 2023 to 16% in the second quarter of 2024 (Chart 5, panel a). The indicator for the third quarter of 2024 points to a slight cyclical pick-up in labour hoarding, but to levels significantly lower than those at its peak of 27.4% in the third quarter of 2022. The main driver behind the broad weakening of the labour hoarding indicator is the lower activity margin (Chart 5, panel b). Given that this margin depicts the extent to which adverse shocks affect firms’ outlooks, this suggests that euro area firms are gradually recovering from the energy price shock. In addition, the employment margin, which reflects the ability of firms to retain their workers while contending with these shocks, has been gradually decreasing, suggesting that the buffers that allowed firms to retain their workforce are dissipating. The employment margin of labour hoarding returned to its pre-pandemic level of 73% in the second quarter of 2024, but fell to 70% in the third quarter, 8 percentage points below its peak of 78% in 2022-23. This suggests that firms that are still being affected by negative shocks now have less scope for retaining their workers than in the past, which could be of relevance given that negotiated wages, and consequently labour costs, have been increasing in 2024.[11]Despite the cyclical increase, the ECB labour hoarding indicator still points to a gradual diminishing of the ability or willingness of firms to retain their workforce, which is broad-based across sectors and particularly strong in market services (Chart 6).The cyclical increase in the labour hoarding indicator in the third quarter of 2024 was common to the industry, construction and market services sectors. This is indicative of an aggregate systemic weakness in the economy that is not being led by any individual sector. While the labour hoarding indicator increased slightly in the third quarter of 2024, the overall trend points to a gradual return to its pre-pandemic levels in all broad sectors of economic activity. In the third quarter of 2024, the labour hoarding indicator also decreased year on year in all sectors, falling by 5.6 percentage points in industry, by 2.7 percentage points in construction and by 2.0 percentage points in the market services sector as compared with the same quarter in 2023. The decline in labour hoarding observed in the market services sector in the third quarter of 2024 was driven both by a lower activity margin (down by 1.2 percentage points as compared with the third quarter of 2023) and by a narrower employment margin (down by 4.3 percentage points). By contrast, the fall in the activity margin in the industry and construction sectors in the third quarter of 2024 (of around 3.5 percentage points for industry and 1.7 percentage points for construction as compared with the same quarter in 2023) was offset by an increase in the employment margin in both sectors, leading to a smaller decrease in the ECB labour hoarding indicator in these sectors than that which the activity margin would otherwise suggest.It is important to continue to monitor the resilience of firms to adverse shocks and their ability to hoard labour when needed.Euro area firms proved to be highly resilient to the very adverse economic conditions arising from the pandemic-induced lockdowns and the surge in energy prices. The ensuing high profit margins and strong labour hoarding have supported employment growth since the surge in inflation. The expected normalisation of these factors could lead to a gradual deceleration in employment growth over the next few years and may give increasing importance to other channels of adjustment within the euro area labour market, such as changes in labour supply owing to increased workforce participation or cyclical fluctuations in unemployment rates and in labour market transitions from employment into inactivity in the event of a weakness in labour demand.Average hours worked per employee remained at a relatively lower level following the pandemic, yet helped the labour market to remain resilient in terms of the extensive margin.In the second quarter of 2024, average hours worked were still 1.2% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019 (Chart 7, panel a), meaning that the average person employed in the euro area worked five hours less per quarter in 2024 compared with before the pandemic. The decline in average hours worked was primarily driven by the public sector and manufacturing (-2.0% and -1.3% respectively), but no sector, other than real estate, has recovered to its pre-pandemic level owing to changes in both labour demand and supply.Employment growth has remained resilient, despite a slowdown in demand in some sectors and lower average hours worked.Recent evidence provided by the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises and the ECB Corporate Telephone Survey shows that the lower hours worked were, to some extent, also driven by a reduced need for workers. Firms, in particular in the manufacturing sector, reported weaker demand as a key factor for reduced working time. Alongside current demand levels, firms confirmed that labour hoarding was an important factor behind the declining number of hours worked per employee. For firms, the decrease in average hours worked attributable to lower demand therefore had a structural component, owing to difficulties in hiring new workers, but also had a cyclical component that could be expected to disappear as demand rises.On the labour supply side, lower average hours worked are mainly driven by less overtime and a higher prevalence of persons who did not work in the reference week.Overall, average hours worked in 2022, as measured in the European Union Labour Force Survey, were 0.71 hours per week below their 2019 level.[12]Around one-third of this difference (0.26 hours) was due to a higher proportion of people working zero hours during the reference week compared with before the pandemic (Chart 7, panel b). While this was initially attributable primarily to sick leave during and after the pandemic, more recently, new contract types introduced in France and Spain have increased the frequency of zero hours worked.[13]Another third of the difference (0.23 hours) was driven by a fall in the number of long hours worked (defined as more than 49 hours per week). Although those working long hours are only a very small percentage of the total workforce, they saw a stark reduction in their working time, reflecting a long-term trend. As regards the last third, average hours worked for the remaining population are 0.22 hours below their pre-pandemic level. This means that a significant proportion of the lower average hours worked is due to a rise in the proportion of zero hours worked and a fall in the proportion of long hours worked.There would seem to have been little change in employees working time preferences following the pandemic, suggesting that there will be no future increase in the number of hours supplied and that these preferences will continue to act as a drag on average hours worked.In line with the fall in average hours worked, the European Union Labour Force Survey shows that the preference for working fewer hours is on a declining trend which was not affected by the pandemic. In 2023, while full-time workers and persons employed in managerial positions had no desire to work more hours, part-time workers and workers in elementary occupations were looking to work more intensively. Given that the lower hours worked are explained by lower labour demand in certain sectors only, a closure of the gap in hours worked compared with the pre-pandemic level would require an increase in supplied hours worked. However, working time preferences overall suggest only limited support for a rise in average hours worked in the future and therefore limited downward risks for employment growth.The euro area labour force has increased strongly over recent years and remains substantially higher than its pre-pandemic trend, helping firms to address labour shortages.While the pandemic temporarily discouraged participation in the labour market, the labour force participation rate has since recovered and even surpassed its pre-pandemic levels (Chart 8, panel a). That rate decreased by 2.5 percentage points between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020. This reflected a fall in the euro area active working age population of 3.8%, with more than 6 million workers temporarily leaving the labour force during the pandemic according to the data from the European Union Labour Force Survey. Thereafter, the labour force quickly recovered. The labour force participation rate returned to its pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of 2021 and by July 2024 the labour force was some 8.6 million above the figure in January 2020, standing 5.3% higher than during the pre-pandemic period. This rate equates to an upwards trajectory of 0.2% per year since 2022, compared with 0.1% between 2009 and 2020.[14]The increased availability of workers may have supported the behaviour of firms in terms of hiring the workers they lacked, or expected to lack, during a period of labour shortages, despite the weak economic environment.Transitions from inactivity to employment were the main driver of employment growth.The widespread support from job retention schemes helped to contain the flow from employment to inactivity during the pandemic, thereby preventing a larger and more permanent decline in the labour force. While the increase in labour market discouragement following the pandemic was temporary, the recovery followed different paths across different countries. Chart 8, panel a) shows that France, Spain and the Netherlands recovered to their pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of 2021, while Germany and Italy took longer (second quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023 respectively). The pandemic also had a strong impact on teleworking possibilities, increasing the participation of the most impacted groups (women, older workers and workers with a tertiary education).Compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, the higher labour force participation rate is currently accounted for primarily by women, older workers, workers with a tertiary education and foreign workers (Chart 8, panel b).Across gender groups, men accounted for a 0.5 percentage point increase in the labour force participation rate as compared with its pre-pandemic level, while a 0.7 percentage point rise was attributable to women. As regards age groups, both young and older workers contributed to the higher labour force participation rate, accounting for 0.4 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points respectively, with prime-aged workers having a downward impact on the labour force participation rate, standing at -0.9 percentage points. With regard to educational level (or skills) groups, those with a tertiary education were responsible for most of the increase in the labour force participation rate, seeing a 2.9 percentage point rise. Conversely, those with a lower level of education contributed negatively to the labour force participation rate, with a fall of 0.6 percentage points, as did workers with a secondary education (medium-skilled workers), down by 1.1 percentage points. In terms of nationality, the contribution of native workers to the rise in the labour force participation rate was insignificant, whereas foreign workers contributed by 1.2 percentage points.Two factors underlie the increase in the labour force participation rate across sociodemographic groups: (i) the increase in each group’s participation rates and (ii) changes in each group’s share in the working age population since the onset of the pandemic.Changes in the composition of the working age population are important for quantifying the contributions of each group to the increase in the labour force participation rate. For example, the ageing of the population can be seen from the sharp reduction in prime-aged workers in the working age population and the strong rise in older workers.[15]While the labour force participation rate for prime-aged workers strengthened between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2024, the sharp decline of this group in the working age population contributed negatively to the overall increase in the labour force participation rate. The same was true for persons with a secondary education. As regards nationality, there was a rise in the working age population for foreign workers in the euro area and a corresponding reduction in the working age population for native workers. Given that both groups saw labour force participation rate increases, their contributions were still positive, albeit around zero for native workers.Recent survey results suggest that firms expect employment growth to slow over the near term (Chart 9, panel a).The quarterly Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises asks euro area firms about their employment expectations over the coming 12 months. The results of the most recent survey for the third quarter of 2024 suggest that firms were expecting a continued slowdown in their employment growth. Average employment growth expectations in the euro area as indicated by the survey stood at 1% year on year in the third quarter of 2024, down from 1.3% in the second quarter. This is broadly in line with the near-term slowdown in employment growth foreseen in theDecember 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. The European Commission’s survey-based Employment Expectations Indicator, which captures firms’ employment growth expectations for the next three months, also points to muted employment growth expectations. Across sectors, employment growth expectations remain the highest for services and the lowest for the industrial sector. In addition, employment growth expectations have become more aligned with the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (Chart 9, panel a), suggesting that productivity growth will improve. While the two indicators co-moved until the end of 2021, from 2022 onwards employment growth expectations remained consistently higher than economic sentiment, reflecting the lower productivity growth observed during that period.The unemployment rate is expected to remain low over the coming quarters.Following a spike at the outbreak of the pandemic, the unemployment rate expectations of professional forecasters and consumers have fallen steadily. The ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters indicates that the unemployment rate in the euro area is expected to remain stable over the near and long term, and close to its lowest level since the introduction of the euro (Chart 9, panel b). In the latest wave of the survey from the fourth quarter of 2024, the average 12-month ahead forecast stood at 6.5% and the distribution of estimates was roughly balanced around the average. Expectations of the unemployment rate five years ahead were slightly lower, averaging 6.4%. These expectations for the near-term unemployment rate are closely aligned with the average unemployment rate for 2025 of 6.5% foreseen in theDecember 2024 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. They are also broadly in line with the expectations of households elicited from the ECB Consumer Expectations Survey. In the most recent wave of this survey, respondents reported lower unemployment rate expectations than in the previous survey,[16]albeit slightly above those of professional forecasters (Chart 9, panel b).Overall, survey data suggest a relatively stable labour market looking ahead.Employment growth is expected to moderate, whereas unemployment is expected to remain low. Employment expectations also seem to be aligning more closely with expectations for economic activity, which suggests a recovery in productivity growth going forward. Survey-based expectations would therefore appear to support a cyclical adjustment in the labour market.Labour market resilience is an important determinant in assessing future wage and inflation developments.By closely monitoring labour market resilience, policymakers can better predict and manage inflation, ensuring sustainable economic growth and stability. The factors determining labour market resilience affect the response of inflation to economic shocks differently. The current resilience in employment has been driven primarily by the labour hoarding tendencies of firms and by the immediate adjustment of real wages in response to the energy crisis. Much of the recent strength observed in the euro area labour market can therefore be attributed largely to cyclical factors, which are generally expected to dissipate going forward.Looking ahead, the euro area labour market is expected to return closer to its historical correlation with output, given that it is anticipated that some of the cyclical factors that sustained employment will abate.Energy and intermediate input prices are normalising, albeit at a higher level, while inflation is falling and real wages are rebounding. This will make the substitution between labour and other inputs less relevant. As profits stabilise and demand weakens, the incentive for firms to hoard labour will diminish. Structural factors, such as a negative trend in average hours worked and labour force dynamics, are likely to persist over the medium term. Other structural elements are poised to significantly influence future developments in labour markets. Key among these are the ongoing reallocation of resources and the efforts being made to support a green and digital transition. Furthermore, sociodemographic changes will play a critical role in shaping labour market dynamics.']}"
